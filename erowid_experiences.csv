Death by Astonishment,Outis,2023-09-13,2025-03-02,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 47,Very Highly Recommended,175.0,lb,"There are infinite ways to begin this narrative, just as I’ve learned today that there are infinite possible forms in this never-ending universe. I began writing this report only a few hours after the conclusion of my first (and possibly my last) psilocybin therapy session on June 20, 2023. I say “last” not because it was bad, but because another one, at this moment, seems unnecessary: the message was abundantly clear and overwhelming.
I can still feel lingering physical effects (e.g., hearing chirping birds that aren’t there), and I am certain the psychological and emotional effects will endure – some perhaps for the rest of my life. According to my guide (my teacher, brother, and friend), I had a “big experience” with an overpowering sense of “non-dual” reality. During the journey itself, I labelled what I felt, “dying,” but by that point, all labels, categories, and concepts had no meaning. Meaning itself didn’t seem important anymore. Nothing seemed important; importance is just a concept, like all the other concepts we use in this world to help us do things. I simply surrendered to the infinite bliss of total self-dissolution.
Whatever one might call it, it has been the most profound experience of my life. I have just completed the 30-question Mystical Experience Questionnaire (a few hours after the journey), and further to my amazement, all my answers are fives, the highest number on the scale.
Background
I am a 47-year-old who’s been interested in psychedelics since first encountering the work of Terence McKenna as a teenager. My experience with mind-altering substances has been minimal: routine caffeine and alcohol, as well as some light and very infrequent cannabis use. In a few cases, anxiety, depersonalization, and derealization hung on long after consuming strains high in THC, leading me to mostly avoid cannabis. In recent years, I have done five IM ketamine treatments in clinical settings. These treatments improved my openheartedness, reduced my fear of psychedelics, and increased my interest in psilocybin, which the voters in my U.S. state legalized in 2022.
Although I was reared by parents who practiced spiritual traditions, I do not consider myself a spiritual person. In fact, I tend to silently scoff at people’s experiences of the mystical and divine. My practices involve hikes in the mountains and occasionally staring in wonder at the clouds and stars. I tilt toward rational, scientific, and analytical thinking. However, my interest in psychedelics and mysticism (through commentators including Watts, McKenna, Dass, Campbell, etc.) demonstrates a simultaneous interest in the ineffable, which I had never personally experienced beyond a few fleeting encounters with clairvoyance and premonition. I have long been skeptical that ineffable experience was worth talking about, since to be made meaningful, it must be brought into the realm of language. In hindsight, and according to my guide, this philosophical framework, somewhat paradoxically, may have helped me better understand and integrate what I experienced.
Preparation, Set, and Setting
I am six-feet tall, 175 pounds, and aside from chronic back pain, fairly healthy. If I have suffered severe trauma in my life, I am unaware of it. I have a general sense of wellbeing and mostly positive self-regard. My intentions were to use this experience to satisfy a lifelong and intense curiosity, as well as a sense of personal and professional obligation to try this newly decriminalized medicine. I wanted to see if doing so might impart some knowledge or self-realization (hat tip Michael Pollan), and I wanted to finally overcome my fear of psychedelics. The three words I wanted to remember during the journey were: surrender, trust, and safety.
The setting was my home, with a small sofa-bed used for the session. My guide measured and prepared a tea of 3-grams of Ghost and Steel Magnolia mushrooms. We sat in ceremony, and then I drank the mixture out of a cup I’d made. The single dose was taken at approximately 10:30 am. It tasted surprisingly good, reminding me of shitake mushroom soup. My guide sat next to me, close enough to hold my hand, which he did for nearly the entirety of the journey once it intensified.
Having such a profound experience (as I describe below) on 3-grams of mushrooms may seem unusual, but I am sensitive to medicines in general, and I had also fasted for 48-hours before the experience (nothing but water). My guide told me after the session that he would have liked to have known about my fast. I presume it might have helped him better gauge the likely effects and duration of my dose.
Guide’s Notes
It is cliché that nothing can fully prepare someone for the experience of ego-death on a dose of psychedelic mushrooms (although careful preparation is still absolutely needed). I was neither seeking nor expecting the death of my ego. I didn’t think it was even possible on three grams. But I can report that my experience was highly similar to other ego-dissolving trip reports I have read/heard. In fact, I learned today that most of the clichés about the psilocybin experience are true: visions of figures, images, and animals (in my case, tiki gods, Indonesian Batik patterns, and benevolent serpents); colors and geometry of unbelievable complexity and beauty. I laughingly reported to my guide: “I can see ultraviolet now!”; unity with all beings and all times; no self-other distinction; complete surrender of all categories and concepts (especially self and time); and the feeling of being part of the never-ending multiplicity of the blissful unfolding of forever. Clearly, the previous sentence also reveals the accuracy of the cliché that words fail to adequately capture the experience. I knew that truism intellectually before today, but I understand and feel its accuracy differently now. During the journey, feelings of overwhelming love were accompanied by unending awe and astonishment, feelings that I’d heard others talk about on countless
video trip reports I’d watched. After today, I better understand these reports and find myself chuckling at instances where I now exclaim, when watching: “Yes!” “Me too!” or “I know!”
What follows is a transcript based on my guide’s notes. Reading this transcript is, to me, astonishing. I would not believe this journey happened if it were not for both my guide’s notes and my fading recollections. I have not tried to interpret much of what I said. No interpretation seems needed.
About 45-minutes into the journey, the blackness of my eye mask became a screen for flowing colors: iridescent, shimmering, and self-transforming rainbows abounded. These were undoubtably shaped by the songs from the album, “Migration,” by Peter Kater and R. Carlos Nakai, which my guide selected for my journey. Acknowledging the visuals, he suggested going deeper. I surrendered even more to “mama mushroom.”
I began sobbing, thinking of the intense love I felt from, and for, my mother. “She loved me so much!” I exclaimed. “When I was a baby, she never let me cry … I love my son the same way my mama loved me,” I said, through tears.
My guide asked me if I thought I would want a booster dose. I was surprised, because it seemed very early in the journey, and the effects were much gentler than 100-mgs of ketamine (which I’d tired before). I was tempted for a moment to say “yes” to the booster, but having mentioned my mother, I felt she would have wanted her “baby boy” to stay safe, and since safety was one of my three words for the journey, I declined the booster dose. I’m glad I did because what then occurred was overwhelming. I am sure I would have been unable to stand any more medicine.
My thoughts returned to my mother, who is elderly and in poor health. “I love you so much,” I burbled through my tears. “You kept me warm and safe, and I want you to be warm and safe. I want you to be okay,” I cried. I then decided to release my mom and continue to move through the beautiful, soothing, breathing colors. The musical lightshow in my mind incorporated visions of meandering, benevolent serpents.
Then, I confronted before me: “something.” Feeling “infinite serenity and peacefulness,” I asked out loud, “What is it?” I can now barely see it in my mind’s eye,
an infinitely transformable, fluid, multi-dimensional column or pillar of everything imaginable. Whatever can be imagined rises to its surface. I saw arising on the edge of it something that I knew to be “me,” the human me that was born, is having this material existence, and that will one day die and return to “it.” I was certain that this “thing,” whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished.
I was certain that this “thing,” whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished.
I was in awe. My guide recorded my utterances:
“I’m astounded!”
“I had no idea… the infinite possibilities.”
“Infinite combinations, forever. Forever!”
“Whatever it is, I see it.”
“Infinite. Infinite. Infinitely changing.”
“I’m from that. I popped out [of it]. I am one of those changes.”
“My mom, she loved me. I feel it. I am sooo lucky to be bathed in that love.”
“[It] is really fucking infinite! I am persuaded! I am astonished! I. Am. In. Awe!”
“There is no boundary between us. You are me, and I am you.”
“I’ll leave that pain behind. It’s back there.”
“You want to show me that? Ok… [a moment later] It’s sooo beautiful! Really!?! [sobbing through tears] I. Am. Astonished!!!”
“I understand. I get it. Thank you!” [laughing and sobbing through more tears]
“Oh. My. God. The ecstasy!!!
“I really am!?! Ok. It’s sooo much. I’m from there!?! Ok.” [laughter]
“Oh. My. God!”
“Isn’t it great!?!” It’s fucking great!!! Put that in the book, I say: “It’s fucking great!!!”’ There’s your testimonial!”
“There is no difference.”
“I cannot believe how good it feels. Unbelievably blessed.”
“I want to do for You. [anguish] I am just so grateful. What do you want me to do, and I will do it. [sobbing] Of course, I will… just show me what to do.”
“It says, ‘just do what you’re doing.’”
“That’s it!?! That’s it, huh? Just bathe in it forever? [smiling] Really? Okay.”
“Why are you so nice to me? I asked you to be [nice to me], that’s true. Thank you. It feels so good.”
“It wants me to tell you, there is no ‘you.’”
“We all go here? Really!?! Okay. Really!?! Because right here is sooo good. I am overwhelmed with the goodness of it all. I am convinced of the overwhelming goodness of it all. If I live here forever, I am fine with it! Just put an exclamation point on the page [and close the book]. [laughter]
“[It] is beyond the discourse. The rapture.”
“You’ve convinced me.”
“Shall we stay here?”
“It said it gave me this body as a gift, to feel these things.”
“‘Oh, we’ll convince you’ [it says]. It’s So. Much. Love! Oh. My. God. The ECSTACY!!! Soothing, basking in it. Eternal bliss.”
“Don’t you [people on Earth] want to try this never-ending bliss, forever? [laughing] It’s right here [in a mushroom, right behind your eyelids, or in front of your nose]. Forever. Unbelievable.” [laughing]
“I don’t understand why anybody would be frightened of it, ever. There is nothing to be afraid of. It’s just pure, never-ending bliss forever.” [laughter, smiling]
“Something died, and I left it behind.”
“It is showing me that I am part of this. I’m in bliss forever. Oh. My. God. It’s showing me.”
“This is where we all end up. ‘Are you ok with it [it is asking me]’? Yes! Why wouldn’t I be ok with it!?!” [laughing]
“It’s beyond any kind of rational understanding or any concepts of any kind.”
“We are love and light and bliss forever. Oh my God, the rapture is so glorious.”
[I ask for the time, and it is 1:15 pm]. “I don’t even know what that means.” [time] [laughter]
“‘Here monkey [human, it is saying], let me show you a little of this.’ I can’t explain it. The Infinite.”
“You can’t bring any of it back [lamenting]. [It’s] ineffable.”
“There is no ‘there’ or ‘out there.’”
“I died.”
[after a period of silence, when my guide asked how I was doing] “I just died and am in peace.”
“I don’t know who I am.”
“There is no boundary between whatever it is and us. We are it. We are that. Whatever it is.”
[coming to just a bit from the effects of the medicine. Removing my eye mask] “I don’t know where I was. I don’t know what a body is. I went to a realm that is beyond everything. I can see how people say you are one with God. Every category and every boundary are obliterated. I can’t understand what “that” is. [But] I am no longer afraid of death. [It] is beyond categories or concepts. Why would anyone want to be born [separated from it]? I don’t know if I will ever come back [to Earth]. Part of me doesn’t want to come back. There are no pains [in that place] in my body. You just get to be whatever ‘that’ is for eternity. Then you wake up. Whatever that was, there, it’s everything. Always. Forever.”
[struggling to return from the medicine] “There is a knowing [in my mind] or a part of me that knows I exist [as a human on Earth]. I am aware of having a body, but I am just existence. Is it ok to go back [to the endless non-place]? I guess I will just exist here now [in the endless non-place].”
[coming too even more now from the medicine] “I don’t know what anything means anymore. But some part of me knows that I’m a primate that needs water. [drinks water] There are days, sun, stars, existence [on Earth]? Holy shit! There is something called ‘reality’ that I know I will want to attend to. You can stop caring about being ‘normal.’ Normal was overrated.”
[the subsequent exchanges were not recorded, but I was struggling with my identity and the nature of reality for about an hour – see “Cautions” below.]
Unasked Questions Answered
I want to make it clear that I did not consume psilocybin with an intent to gain answers to existential or metaphysical questions. Yet, the medicine delivered “news” that cannot be ignored.
I feel like a snake that has shed its skin - a man reborn on June 20, 2023. I feel like I can take from old “me” that which is useful and now leave behind all those memories, habits of mind, and concerns that no longer serve.
Part of me wishes I had come to this transformation earlier in my life, but the truth is, I probably wasn’t ready. I undertook this journey at an apex in my professional and personal life, which likely accounts for the strong, positive experience I had. My Living Will had been written earlier, my “one good book” had been finished, and I was prepared to die of a heart attack or suffer psychosis. I was free to fully let go.
I now believe that non-discursive, ineffable experience is possible. In fact, I would encourage any skeptic of mysticism or spirituality, like me, to try an ego-dissolving dose of psylocibin. I would challenge that person to maintain their skepticism when confronted with their experience.
I now feel like I know where we “go” when we die. I did not seek to know this, but I have seen and felt what I believed to be the source of all existence, and you and me and everything we can sense are the material expressions of its timeless, unending transformation and expression. I believe the self that I call “me” materially emerged from this source when I was conceived about nine months before my birth. When I die, my consciousness will return to this source in a way that may be like what I felt during my psilocybin journey. Another experience of “me” (as a rock, ant, bird, human, or alien, etc.) may be expressed again in some other time or material plane of existence, or not, I really don’t know. However, I believe everyone I have known, and everything in this universe, emerged from this same source and are just expressions of it. In that way, we are all connected and all the same. Materially, we are all created from the same dust of stars, and existence is just each atom of each speck of dust. I now better understand what Alan Watts meant when quoting Hindu text that declared, “You are That!”
Where does this existence reside? Does it encompass the distant reaches of space, is it inside our brain, just behind our eyelids, or in the smallest constituent quark of an atom? My answer is “Yes” and “I don’t know.” I am a mere hominid who consumed psilocybin and experienced something that cannot be explained in words or other symbols. While I have seen art that resembles aspects of what I saw and felt, it does not fully capture the astonishing awe and reverence that occurred while feeling the soothingly undulating, forever-transforming source of all existence, of which I am, and all things are, expressions separated only while we are experiencing our various material forms.
Do I believe in God now? If anyone wants to label what I saw and felt “God,” I won’t object. But I won’t use that word because it’s just a word (a highly loaded one), and words have no meaning in the place I experienced. I believe I saw or experienced the source of all existence. But I happily concede that I could have been merely hallucinating on mushrooms.
Did I go “full hippie,” and can I see God in a cabbage now? I can appreciate that everything is an expression of the source of all creation, but a cabbage isn’t the source, it’s a material expression of the source (and good in stir-fry). No, I do not suddenly believe in astrology, teleportation, past lives, astral projection, ghosts, or other such phenomena beyond them being amusing and sometimes useful concepts in our world.
What is the purpose of life? I don’t know the purpose of anyone else’s life. I begged the source of all existence to tell me how I could “give back” for all the blessings I’ve had in mine. It only told me to keep doing what I’m doing. I said, “That’s it?” I couldn’t believe it. “Why are you so nice to me?” I asked? “It’s true, I asked you to be nice to me. Thank you,” I said. I don’t understand it all, but I feel mostly relieved of the burden to keep asking myself what I should be doing to give back – the answer to that question, I know now, continually unfolds inside my heart. I can listen any time.
I called my mom sometime after my journey to tell her again how much I love her, and how I know (maybe more than ever) how much she loved/ loves me. It was a beautiful conversation that probably would not have occurred otherwise.
Two days after my journey, I can see some lingering effects, including an ability to better choose how I want to respond to people and situations around me. I find it easier to say “with love” in texts and emails to friends, and I feel more open and compassionate. My usual irritation with people and processes has, thankfully, eased. Yet, there is nothing remaining of the blissful astonishment I felt during my journey.
I am still in a bit of shock about what happened to me. My skepticism is returning, but I cannot deny that I said and felt these things. In that way, I guess, I remain astonished.
Don’t let a 3-gram dose fool you: I completely dissolved. A guide should be someone absolutely trusted with one’s life and sanity. More than five hours after my trip had begun, I felt I had “returned” from wherever I had gone. I no longer had any visual hallucinations or feelings of being “under” the influence of a psychedelic compound. The physical reality of my home had returned to how it always looked and felt. However, I was absolutely convinced that I had died and that whoever “I” was before the experience no longer existed and that the new person I had become would need to reconstruct an identity and relationships from total scratch. I believed I could probably do this with great effort, but I was anxious about doing so. Sensing my unease, my guide walked me to the area of my home where I keep photos of my loved ones and a shrine to my late father, “Do you know who these people are?” he asked. I said I did, but that they mattered to the old me, and the new me would have to learn how to relate to them because the old me had died.
I kept thinking, “The ‘me’ who was here before died, so I guess I will just try to get by with being this crazy person now, doomed to suffer permanent psychosis until I die.” Through the repeated reassurances of my guide, I eventually found a way back to sanity. I looked many times into his eyes to see if he was scared that I had permanently slipped away. Either he genuinely believed I hadn’t, or he was good at pretending (I am sure it was the former). I cannot imagine the panic and horror that I would have felt had he revealed even a flicker of doubt about my condition.
At the very end of my journey, my sanity seemed, at least to me, to be hanging by a thin thread. This occurred after having a gentle (yet awe-inspiring and ego-dissolving) experience that involved no fear whatsoever at any point. While my feeling of permanent psychosis disappeared before my guide left my home, part of the “I” who was “me” really won’t ever come back. Luckily, I had prepared myself to be ok with that outcome.",117453,17,Mushrooms - P. cubensis,3 g,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Puzzling Out a Recipe and a Magic Experience,Maggie1215,2011-09-13,2012-03-06,Gender: Female,Age at time of experience: 44,Very Highly Recommended,130.0,lb,"This is my account as a first-time ayahuasca brewer and user trying to puzzle out a workable recipe using conflicting information gathered from the internet. I post this in the hope that it may help others in their experimentation. It’s quite long and detailed, because I was exploring many questions about optimal preparation and consumption. I focus on these aspects.
First, let me say about myself that I am a PhD student in cognitive psychology, interested in consciousness and the workings of the mind. I’ve taken a graduate psychopharmacology class and done lots of reading on the subject. I have been a life-long empiricist and atheist until I was introduced to psychedelics by my boyfriend about 4 months ago, which has spurred a sort of spiritual awakening and exploration. Starting out with small doses of psilocybin mushrooms, which he grew himself, I have worked my way up from mild trips to a full-blown 6-gram (dried weight) experience. I have also used weed a bit (not very often, I have a difficult time smoking), salvia a few times (plain, 5x, 10x and 20x – all of which I found interesting but too short lasting) and amanita muscaria (which was pleasant, contrary to many internet accounts). My typical drug of choice is alcohol, both beer and red wine, rarely liquor, and I drink several times a week. I’ve also tired nootropics (piracetam, aniracetam) and antidepressants (Effexor, Celexa, Lexapro, Prozac, St. John’s Wort).
My boyfriend is a very experienced psychedelic user, of at least 20 years duration, but had never tried ayahuasca and had always wanted to. We wanted to use the brew for meaningful spiritual exploration, not simply as a new or more intense high. He also is a near daily user of cannabis, and used some throughout the experience detailed below. I did not.
So we decided to welcome in the year 2012 by brewing some. I tried to find an appropriate recipe online by browsing the internet. This was the first problem, as there is extreme variation in recipes, measures and methods. We wanted to start out with an authentic traditional recipe, just Banisteriopsis caapi (sometimes by itself called ayahuasca) and Psychotria viridis (chacruna), with no other additives. However, I found recipes that called for 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 ratios of caapi to chacruna. Even more confusing, some recipes called for a certain number of chacruna leaves, not a given weight. Leaf size was not specified either. And while some recipes specified fresh chacruna, few mentioned dried. More often, recipes just gave a weight, not mentioning fresh or dried at all. I was left wondering which to use and if there was any difference in potency between the two, suspecting that there must be. As mushroom users know, there’s a big difference between the weight of fresh and dried you should use. Likewise, when cooking, you must use much more fresh herb (of any sort, such as basil, etc) than dried. To further confuse the issue, at least three different types of caapi were available – red, white, and yellow – in several different forms – shredded, powdered or whole young vine. Allusions were made to different characteristics of different strains/colors, such as “white is hardest to work with,” but nothing specific. Most recipes just said “caapi.” How to decide?
In the spirit of experimentation, I ordered 4 oz (112g) each of white shredded bark, yellow powdered, and young red vine said to be from a strain from T. McKenna’s plantation. I also ordered 150 g of dried chacruna leaves. The leaves arrived broken into many pieces – there was no way to tell how many leaves there had been originally.  Good thing I decided to go by weight. The leaves were a dark blackish green in color, and slightly dusty smelling. The shredded caapi looked and smelled like rough mulch. My goal was to use a 1:1 ratio of about 200 g of caapi to 200 g of chacruna, and these were the best approximations I could get based on how the items were packaged and sold.
Following is the digest of a lot conflicting recipes and accounts that I read – at least 50 from both websites and academic journals (Journal of Psychoactive Drugs is a good one, as is Psychopharmacology; good researchers are Callaway and Riba. I will give specific references at the end of this account). I found several recurring themes.
1) Some accounts suggested that a smaller proportion of caapi to chacruna resulted in less stomach upset – we were quite cognizant of the fact that we might vomit or have diarrhea, and wanted to minimize it. So I settled on a using close to a 1:1 ratio of caapi to chacruna. I ended up using the white shredded bark and red young vines, for a total of 224 grams of caapi, and the whole bag of 150 g of chacruna. (So if you want to get technical, it’s a ratio of about 1.5:1). See Note 1 at the end of this account for more info about the appropriate/tolerable amount of caapi.
2) Some recipes advised throwing everything in a big pot together and boiling for 10-12 hours. Others said to prepare each plant separately and to do multiple washes/extractions, then to either combine them at the end or to drink separately.  The timing varied from boiling each wash from 5 minutes to 2-3 hours! It seemed from reading many accounts that the most stomach upset/vomiting occurred from the “throw everything together and boil vigorously for 10-12 hour” recipes, while the “do several washes, simmer and strain” recipes led to less vomiting and nausea.
3) Some recipes said to add a teaspoon of so of lemon juice, lime juice, or vinegar, to each wash, though they didn’t say why. Later reading suggested that acidifying the water speeded up the extraction process – thus, requiring a shorter amount of time simmering. Perhaps that was why some recipes said to boil for as little as 5 minutes per wash. A few recipes called for using grapefruit, orange or pineapple juice to make the resulting liquid sweeter – however, in their results, the brewers who used these methods often complained the ayahuasca “didn’t work”, so I steered away from using these juices, which aren’t as acidic as lemon or lime or vinegar. (In reading technical accounts in academic journals, I found that most analyses of authentic ayahuasca found it to have a pH of about 3.5, eg Callaway 2005.) A few accounts said to use anywhere from 250-1000 mg citric acid, presumably dumped out of a capsule or a dissolved dietary supplement. One recipe used “muratic acid”, which I assumed meant “muriatic acid”, which is liquid hydrochloric acid (HCl), a corrosive acid used in swimming pools and for cleaning masonry and doesn’t seem at all a good idea for something you’re going to drink! That recipe produced vomiting, according to its author.
4) Some recipes said to boil; others said never to boil, only to simmer. I mostly simmered, even though that meant it took longer to reduce the liquid. Later I read that simmering rather than boiling resulted in a sweeter (or at least less bitter) brew, due to “no carmelization of the plant material” (according to the author) at below boiling temperatures. My brew was bitter, but not too bad. (One discussion thread I found online said not to boil, as you would destroy (“vaporize,” they said) the DMT by doing so. However, no other accounts said anything about this. Nonetheless, I tried to mostly simmer the liquids, as I certainly didn’t want to lose any DMT, though I think it must vaporize at a higher temperature than boiling.)
5) Most recipes were quite clear against using aluminum pots, saying toxic aluminum salts could result, especially with an acidifying agent.  I made sure my pans were non-aluminum. Pyrex (glass) is a good idea.
6) Most recipes advised using distilled water to avoid any added chemicals, such as chlorine. I did so, about 4.5 gallons altogether (which was reduced by simmering over 6 hours to about 4 cups total).
7) Many experienced users recommended brewing 2 doses per person, in case one was lost to vomiting. Of course, defining a dose was quite confusing due to all the conflicting recipes. I defined a dose as approximately 50 g of caapi and 50 g of dried chacruna. Though the proportions I ended up using were slightly different (I ended up consuming extract from about 60 g caapi and 40 g chacruna.)
8) Some recipes said to drink the caapi about 30 minutes prior to the chacruna. Others said to mix together and drink at the same time. We decided to keep ours separate and 30 minutes apart, thinking that way the MAOI in the caapi would have time to work before the DMT-containing chacruna. (Naturally occurring MAOs in the digestive tract break down oral DMT – the MAO inhibitor in the caapi prevents this. It seemed logical that we should give the MAOI a little bit of time to start inhibiting the MAO before we consumed the DMT so as to reduce breakdown and optimize absorption.)
9) Many recipes advised straining/filtering several times and/or letting the sediment naturally settle over time, suggesting the sediment caused gagging and triggered vomiting. So we did so.
The brew preparation
T –9.00.  At 9:30 am, I added 112 g of white shredded caapi bark, 112 grams of young red caapi vine, 2/3 gallon of distilled water, and a big squirt of lemon and lime juices (probably about a teaspoon’s worth) to a saucepan and brought it to a boil. I then simmered and stirred it for an hour. The liquid turned a dark reddish-brown immediately. I had tried to further grind the young red vine in my coffee grinder, but had no luck, it kept getting caught and wouldn’t really grind, so I just broke it into smaller pieces and threw it in the pot. In retrospect, I wish I had pounded it or crushed it or tried harder to break open the red vine, because I feel like the resulting extract was weak.
At the same time, I put the 150 grams of dried, broken up chacruna leaves in a different pot with 2/3 gallon of water and a squirt of lemon and lime juices and brought it to a boil.  I then simmered it for 2 hours, stirring quite often. At first the liquid was dark greenish-brown, but over several hours it became black. (It looked like black bean soup.)
T –8.00.  At 10:30 am, I took the caapi liquid out, filtered it through a wire mesh strainer, and put it in a smaller saucepan to reduce. I added another 2/3 gallon of water plus more lemon and lime juices to the original caapi vine/bark and simmered it for another hour or so. (The instructions I found online had suggested simmering each wash for anywhere from 5 minutes to 2-3 hours; I compromised on 1-2 hours.) Now I had 3 pans going: the original caapi and chacruna, and one more caapi liquid only.
T –7.00.  At 11:30 am, I strained the chacruna (it seemed to take longer to steep than the caapi – the leaves floated on the surface, and I kept the heat lower so they wouldn’t float over the top). Now I had 4 pans going, the 2 original brews and 2 liquids to reduce. I returned the chacruna to the pot, added more distilled water (enough to cover, still about 2/3 gallon) and more lemon and lime juices and brought to a boil, then simmer, again.
T -6.00 through T -3.00. I repeated this process 1 more time each with the caapi and chacruna, so that each gave 3 washes total. By 3:30 I had only the 2 pots with liquid reducing on the stove and was done with the vine and leaves, which I composted.
At various times, I strained each liquid, first using a small mesh wire strainer, like one of those “permanent” coffee filters, then later trying to use a paper coffee filter. The sediment clogged the paper coffee filter, and I gave up on that method.
T -2.00. I kept filtering, simmering and reducing the liquids until I had slightly less than 2 cups of each. This took until about 4:30 pm.  At this point, I poured each out into a large glass container so that further sediment could settle to the bottom.
Some side notes on the cooking process:  For at least the first few hours, my kitchen smelled strongly of dirt and mulch. At first it was a very acrid, pungent smell, and it spread throughout the house. However, the smell mellowed very much over time, and after a few hours was non-objectionable.
Also, quite a lot of steam was produced throughout this entire process – I had the kitchen exhaust fan going for hours and a window cracked open even though it was snowing outside. Windows throughout the house fogged over. We felt as though we were actually in a steamy rainforest.
Personal preparation and consumption
Knowing that the caapi is a MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor), we abstained from tyramine rich foods all day (no aged cheeses, meats, alcohol, etc.), but didn’t entirely fast. (Many ayahuasca drinkers describe fasting for a day or two before imbibing, but we felt ok just abstaining from problem foods). I had coffee with nonfat milk at about 8 am (T –10.5), but no food. My boyfriend had black coffee and a piece of dry toast with strawberry jelly at noon (T –6.5), as well as a clementine in the late afternoon.  I had 2-3 cups of peppermint tea (100% peppermint leaf) throughout the afternoon, and 3 saltine crackers. I hoped the peppermint might help reduce nausea.
T 0.  At 6:15 pm, we were ready. We had slightly less than 2 cups total of each liquid, which I had calculated to be 4 doses. I scooped out about ˝ c. of caapi for each of us, trying to leave most of the sediment in the bottom. At this point, the liquid was no longer a dark reddish-brown, but a light yellowish-brown. After offering a prayer, we sipped our drinks over about 15-20 minutes. We had read that sipping it slowly over time helped reduce nausea. It was bitter, but not as bad as I’d been expecting.
T +0.5.  After a ˝ hour, I scooped out about ˝. c. of the chacruna liquid for each of us. This was dark black, like black bean soup, and had a lot of sediment. Both of us felt fine before drinking the chacruna, no nausea at all. Once again, we sipped slowly over about 15-20 minutes. It was very bitter and chalky, much worse tasting and grittier than the caapi, but not awful. As my boyfriend neared the end of his, he noted that it contained a lot of sediment. As soon as he said that, he said he was going to lose it and ran to the bathroom. He spent about the next 10 minutes vomiting up everything. I continued to sip mine slowly, avoiding the sediment. At one point when I neared the sediment, I nearly gagged, but was able to stop it. Also, he had consumed a Clementine right before the caapi, (plus the toast and coffee earlier) while I hadn’t eaten anything but the 3 saltines around noon and the peppermint tea. Wikipedia, citing Ott (1994), says that traditionally “caffeine” and “citrus” are avoided prior to ayahausca consumption, though recent researchers are casting doubt on whether these dietary restrictions are necessary. (See note #2 below.)

T +1.00. I feel fine, no nausea.  My boyfriend feels better after purging, but doesn’t want to try any more ayahuasca. We sit back to wait, watching some videos. I’d read that onset of effects could take anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours, and more toward the longer end if you sipped it slowly rather than chugging it all at once, so I’m trying to be patient.
T +1.50.  I examine myself for signs of effects. I feel slightly warm and flushed, a feeling I associate with serotonin (as from taking a migraine pill), maybe a bit of tightness around my eyes like I get with mushroom onset, but no CEV or other effects. We close our eyes and perhaps imagine that we are seeing the slightest flashes of color. I am impatient. My boyfriend smokes a bowl.
T +2.00.  Still nothing. I conclude the brew didn’t work. I pull out a bag of Syrian rue and chew up about a gram’s worth of seeds, thinking maybe I didn’t make the caapi strong enough or drink enough for the MAOI to work. I pour myself an additional Ľ c. each of both caapi and chacruna and start sipping. I also eat about 10 saltines, figuring it’s a lost cause. I’m feeling good, chatty, energized, bubbly, which I attribute to the MAOI effects of the caapi (MAOIs are used as antidepressants; caapi on its own is also said to be a stimulant, eg Rodd 2008), but feel nothing else.
In the meantime, my boyfriend is feeling better and decides to try to salvage the evening by brewing a psilocybin mushroom tea. It is New Year’s Eve after all, and we are afraid to drink alcohol due to the MAOI. We have a small amount of shrooms, about 1-2 g (unfortunately, we didn’t weight them), estimated at enough for one person to have a very mild experience. In a “what the heck, why not?” mode, we toss the mushrooms in a pan along with about 1 gram of crushed Syrian rue (also an MAOI, we hope it might potentiate and “stretch” the mushrooms), then also add 25 g of amanita muscaria we’ve been meaning to try (he’s never had any, but I had tested myself on 5 grams brewed into a tea a few weeks ago. I found them to have a very mild effect, similar to drinking a glass of wine, and no nausea; these are a mixture of grade A large 3” Latvian caps and grade A+ small 1” Washington caps ordered from the internet). We also add a slice of fresh ginger and herbal peppermint-based tea (not 100% peppermint leaf – this is “Candy Cane Lane” Xmas decaf green tea, and also contains milk thistle – recommended by several online accounts to go with the amanita – vanilla, and other flavors).
T +2.25. We drink our tea over about 15-20 minutes, wary of nausea from the amanitas. We experience none. We are listening to Icaros of the Shipibo people culled from the internet to get us in the proper spiritual frame of mind.
T +2.50 or so. Onset is rapid. Something has finally worked in a major way. I don’t know if it was the extra MAOI from the additional caapi or Syrian rue, or the shrooms, or simply time. At this point I lose all sense of time. The rest of the night is sheer magic for me, though not quite as strong for my boyfriend since he lost most or all of his ayahuasca, and I had an additional gram of Syrian rue. Let me just say the experience was everything I had read about and hoped for, totally cosmic, spiritual, out of body. I am full of love and gratitude and feel a sense of timelessness and eternity and oneness with the universe, I feel my boyfriend and I are dreaming its creation. I feel whole and complete and perfect. I feel accepting of every part of myself, even the parts I dislike and try to hide. I feel healed. I have wonderful OEV and CEV. I want this moment to last forever. I feel suspended in time. Spirits walk with us and we commune with them. My boyfriend sees the Mayan calendar unraveled in his mind, and speaks with ancient shamans.
In contrast to my previous experiences with mushrooms, which were more autobiographical in tone (eg, working out conflict with my mother and my brother, reliving childhood, reuniting with my dead father), this one is strictly about myself and my relation to the cosmos.
My experience lasts roughly from 10 pm til 4:30 am, when I start to come out of the bliss phase but am still seeing splashes of color with my eyes open. My boyfriend’s experience, while nearly as intense, ended about 1 ˝ hours previously. (He said it was close to, but not the most, intense experience he’d ever had.) Throughout this roughly 6 hours, he also smoked a bit, estimating that in total he consumed 2 bowls of what he called “high grade” weed.
T +10.  Aftermath: We feel a little twitchy, and my muscles feel as if I worked out my upper body with weights and did a bit of light running or biking. My whole body feels stiff when I stand up to go to the bathroom, and walking feels strange. Mentally, I feel centered, energized, blissful – just really, really good. We have a bit of trouble falling asleep (have some great sex – body sensations are definitely heightened!), and stay awake for another hour or so. Finally fall asleep by about 6 am and sleep til about 10 am. We awake ravenous and have the best food we have ever tasted in our lives. He feels tired and “heavy” and unmotivated all day, which he partially attributes to the weed, but I continue to feel great, with only a bit of a headache and “jaw clench” (both of which I tend to get from too much serotonin – analyses of blood plasma levels in ayahuasca drinkers have shown elevated serotonin levels for 1-2 days afterward, eg Calloway 1999, and I subjectively feel as if my serotonin levels are high).
T +40. The next morning, (this is now 2 days later) I start to feel a bit shaky, sweaty, and light-headed, a feeling I get when tapering off antidepressants too quickly (I’m not taking any currently or wouldn’t have messed around with an MAOI). I pop a 100 mg 5-HTP capsule (a serotonin precursor) and quickly feel better. Except the headache/jaw clench returns, but it’s not too bad, overall I still feel great and energized.
Both of us rated this as one of the most spiritual experiences we have ever had. I don’t know what single element or combination of elements finally worked, but it was simply magic. We’re looking forward to trying a slightly different version, made with Syrian rue and mimosa, and will definitely try the mushroom/Syrian rue combo on its own again, as well as amanitas on their own or maybe with Syrian rue. But a word of warning: make sure you know what you’re dealing with, especially as regards the MAOI. Look it up online, make sure you eat correctly. And be prepared for vomiting or diarrhea. I was lucky – I had no nausea at all, but I tend to have a strong stomach. I believe the low proportion of caapi to chacruna, the slow sipping, and the filtering out of the majority of sediment all helped to reduce the nausea/vomiting experience.
Admittedly, in scientific terms this was not a “clean” experiment – too many variables. However, I think the differences between our 2 experiences, the fact that mine lasted nearly 2 hours longer and was so blissful, was due to the additional MAOI and DMT I consumed. Since my boyfriend vomited so early, we assume he lost all of his DMT and most of the MAOI from the caapi. And as an experienced mushroom user, he said he got much more of an effect out of the paltry 0.5-1 g of mushrooms he consumed than he would have expected, which we attribute to the MAOI in the Syrian rue. (Like all psychedelics, mushrooms increase levels of serotonin; the MAOI allows this serotonin to last longer rather than being broken down right away, thus “potentiating” or intensifying the mushrooms’ effects. In other online accounts I read, it seems as if adding a MAOI effectively doubles the dose of mushrooms.)
Note to point #1, about proportion of caapi and vomiting: Calloway (2005) suggested that the effective dose of caapi in terms of MAOI is near the “point of emesis” (vomiting, that is). He believes vomiting is a “natural reflex” against an overdose of the harmala alkaloids in the caapi that function as the MAOI. Thus, he believes it is impossible to take a fatal dose. The point here is that the effective dose hovers right around the amount that makes you vomit. The MAOI also increases intestinal “motility” (by increasing gut serotonin levels) according to Calloway – too much motility leads to explosive expulsion of the contents of your gut, from the other end.
Note #2, about dietary restrictions. Conventional wisdom on the internet says that since the harmala alkaloids in the caapi (and Syrian rue) function as MAOIs, all tyramine containing foods should be avoided before and after use. However, it appears that these alkaloids are reversible MAOIs (the irreversible MAOIs, such as drugs used as antidepressants,  take up to 2 weeks to recover from) and furthermore only act on the MAO-A system, leaving the MAO-B system intact and working, thus dietary restrictions might be unnecessary. However, in the lack of definitive research, I figure better safe than sorry!  Additionally, recent and seemingly little publicized research on coffee found it to inhibit both the MAO-A and MAO-B systems (Herraiz, 2006). Thus, perhaps my boyfriend had more MAO inhibition going on at the time of drinking the chacruna than I did, which may have caused his vomiting, since as Callaway (2005) found, the effective vs. vomiting-inducing doses are quite close.
Another note: In several analyses of ayahuasca ingredients, Calloway et al. (2005) found wide variation in the levels of active components. For instance, 32 samples of caapi varied from containing 0.31 mg/g to 8.43 mg/g of harmaline alkaloids, while 36 samples of chacruna varied between containing 0.0 mg/g  (yes, 0) of DMT to 7.5 mg/g. Furthermore, levels of DMT in chacruna leaves taken from the same plant at different times over the course of a day could vary in strength. This natural variation only makes it more difficult to estimate proper amounts of the plants to use in tea making. Thus, I believe you should brew at least 2 doses per person and be patient (wait at least 2 hours) before taking more. Leftovers can be frozen for future use, according to internet accounts. I have one leftover dose frozen, and will see how it works in a future encounter.
I also have 4 oz (112 g) of the yellow powdered caapi left to experiment with. Powdered bark was said to be hard to work with by many online accounts – after dealing with the sediment and its filter-clogging and gag-triggering effects, I now understand why. If I use it in the future, I may try to construct some kind of giant “tea bag” filter, maybe sewing 2 coffee filters together around it or finding some very fine cheesecloth to bag it in.

Lost in the Forest of the Mind,Barbarossa,2015-09-13,2025-04-25,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 17,Very Highly Recommended,120.0,lb,"It was early December of 2016 when George texted me asking if I'd like to trip the next morning with him and Paul in the canyon. It was around 1 am, I was up late as usual. I wasn't enthusiastic about it but I said why not, I always wanted to go hiking while tripping, and George would be pushy if I said no. I had tripped on acid maybe 20 times before this, and my max dosage was 5 hits. I had only ever had one mildly bad experience, but nothing horrible.
He picked me up around 6 am. It was colder than I had dressed for, a chilly 50 degrees. We went to the convenience store, had coffee, and stocked up on water and snack foods, then headed toward the summit of the canyon. When we got to the summit, Paul pulled out the acid. It was a Sonic the Hedgehog print, and at the sight of this horrible video game character I got my first bad vibes. George at first was questioning, saying he didn't wanna drop until we reached the waterfall at the bottom of the gorge. But we had only planned for a day hike, and since the acid would be peaking right around the time we reached the waterfall, we each took 3 hits.
The descent then commenced. It was around 7 am. I distributed apple Trident layers gum to Paul, George and myself, a brand I still cannot chew because of the memory I would soon attach to it. The acid took a while to kick in. We must've been an hour and a half into our journey before I began to feel any effects, which was unusual for me. As we reached the bottom of the canyon and headed toward the waterfall, I could finally feel it. Everything was beautiful, shimmering and breathing. We crossed the water on a log foot bridge, standing outside of time and admiring its beauty. We walked into a great opening and I let out a primal yawp. This was the best trip ever, in terms of the visuals I was perceiving.
We then began to walk through a small forest. It was dark but beautiful. Around this time was when things began to foreshadow the dark turn ahead. George commented that the forest reminded him of Aokigahara Forest - the Japanese wood of the suicides near Mt. Fuji infamous for the high incidence of people killing themselves in it's vast expanse. But at the time I thought nothing of the comment.
We then exited the densest part of the forest and began walking along the stream that would culminate in the waterfall. The rocky climbing, up-and-down motion was tiring. We took a break to eat. I took out a pastry and began eating it when I was suddenly overcome with the feeling that I was drowning, not on water but on air. I pulled out a bottle of water and poured in onto my face, trying to 'breathe' it. I quickly snapped out of it and began repeating 'I'm going to be ok. I'm going to be ok.' George was eating beef jerky - in retrospect, not a good thing to eat on acid - and seemed to be feeling bad vibes himself. We both told Paul that we should return to the jeep, but Paul insisted we trek further. He said we had to see the waterfall.
So we continued onward until we reached the falls. It hadn't rained in a while. The water was weak flowing, and the barren, desolate, neutral toned rocky landscape where once water flowed abundantly was menacing. An old man was there before us, and as we approached the falls, he was walking back in the direction he came from. He asked us how we were doing and tried to strike up a conversation. I did my best to play it cool, telling him we were hiking and really not much else. Despite how nervous I was, I was surprisingly more extroverted than I am usually. I did not feel like myself.
George's mind was at this point thoroughly warped. He thought every elderly man he had ever met was now the same person. Thinking this was the gentleman who owned the local burger joint, he praised the dude and said he loved his burgers. The man was confused. I have no recollection how that topic was ended, but before the man continued back home, he said he was enjoying this hike for the first and last time, before he was too old to see it. My memory here begins to get spotty, but I believe I started accidentally talking about mortality, saying something along the lines of 'Yeah well me and my friends are still young. We aren't going to die soon like you,' but the way I said it was in no way intentionally rude or mean.
This is where time stops. George begins shivering, and for what was either 3 minutes or half an hour, Paul and I huddled up to him, afraid that we would all soon die from the environment. George was going back and forth between the best mood he had been in and the deepest pits of existential horror. At one point, trying to encourage and help him, I pointed to the wilderness surrounding us and told him I was proud of him because he created it all.
While walking up the falls, several odd statements ensued. I became convinced that Paul was an ape. This was both physical, he's a very brutish looking dude, and because George and I often jab at him for being very primitive. Helping George climb up a particularly steep area, he looked at me wide-eyed and then called me 'brother', hugged me, and said 'thank you for saving me, god', addressing me as a deity. I, looking around, said, 'wow, this environment looks so real, the developers really outdid themselves on make a convincing video game'.
Paul is a very easy going, passive man who doesn't hold aggression towards anyone. George on the other hand is very pushy and willful. At one point Paul said something about some cheesy psychedelic rock band. An inside joke with us is mocking Paul's very narrow, limited taste. George calls him a void of a man because he really lacks depth, and doesn't ever really express himself beyond dopey yes/no terms. This must've really enraged George, because he then proceeded to punch him. I could feel reverberations through the atmosphere. Suddenly I became convinced that George would kill Paul, and then God would smite us. I broke it up and got George off of him. Things went back to normal. Or as normal as they can be, I guess, and we reached the top of the falls.
At one point we had to cross the relatively shallow stream. Rather than stepping on the stones to stay dry, I waded waist deep and began to tell Paul and George about my fear of drowning and of bodies of water, which is rooted in an early childhood near death experience.
George pulled out his phone. I associate phones with bad trips because mine was heavily linked to my first, relatively mild bad trip, so I avoid them altogether in trips now. I looked at his screen. He had his girlfriend's last name listed as 'blah blah blah'. I felt like this was some glitch in the system of reality and, alarmed, I wagged my finger and said 'no phones'. George looked astonished, as if I had just revealed the nature of reality to him, and adamantly threw his phone into the stream, something which we only later found out wasn't a hallucination.
For the next six hours, I relived my entire life over and over, at least 5 times. I recalled vividly the last time I had hiked in this canyon, with my father years before, and had illusions of killing him. I heard sirens all around me. I began writing in my notebook. I had no idea what I was writing at the time. George told me to write something in his handwriting with my hand, and then began ranting about how much he missed living in California. He became convinced that his uncle (who raised him) was dead. I retorted by saying our favorite professor was still alive, thus his uncle couldn't be dead. For a while we rocked back and forth in our separate insanities, me pleading for my mom and him for his uncle.
At one point I began narrating his consciousness - something I really have no other way of explaining. As he began ranting about his hatred for his cousin, I critiqued various aspects of his personality. This was a major event for him, but for me it was mostly impersonal and I don't recall much of it.
I sat down cross legged and closed my eyes. I was trying to snap out of it. But suddenly I felt like I was falling down a massive, endless pit, totally devoid of light. All around I heard the sounds of people coughing, choking, water splashing and occasionally a scream. I felt like I was in another dimension, beyond life and death. I felt like I was living in a facade, a simulation, and I had taken acid as a way to break free of this Matrix-like Baudrillardian nightmare, and now my interdimensional overlords, or God, or the aliens or whatever were punishing me for it,

I felt like I was living in a facade, a simulation, and I had taken acid as a way to break free of this Matrix-like Baudrillardian nightmare, and now my interdimensional overlords, or God, or the aliens or whatever were punishing me for it,
sending me through a void of information overlord and breaking my mind with a jackhammer.
I came to and checked my watch. It was now 3pm. I had lost consciousness some 5 hours before. But suddenly I began to feel okay. Things still felt weird, but I could tell I was sobering up. George also snapped out of it at the same time. What was happening to Paul all this time? He was somehow totally unaffected and managed to have a good trip. I have scattered memories of him waving his fingers at us and saying 'snakes', at which point they looked like snake emojis to me, as well as him standing on a tall rock and calling himself the Lizard King. He did nothing to help us during our bad experiences. During all of this, I recall voices sounding like they were backtracked and just incredibly off, like the voice of the dwarf in the dream sequence of Twin Peaks.
After coming back to a relatively sound state of mine, I ran to the base of the waterfall to take a piss. It felt like it went on forever, and while I pissed I felt as if I was being stabbed all over my body. I looked in my journal. I had wrote 'please someone help me. My name is Harry. I have taken a substance I do not know what. My address is 123 Sesame Street. Please call this number and have them come pick me up. Please have mercy upon me God'
We descended back to the base of the waterfall. He grabbed at his pockets, realizing he didn't have his phone. We both simultaneously recalled him tossing it into the stream. He rushed to the stream and found it, terrified that it was destroyed. Miraculously, it survived over 5 hours totally submerged and still works perfectly to this day.
We walked back to the jeep, a journey which lasted about 3 hours. We didn't talk much, all of us trying to come to terms with what had just happened and focusing on getting back to the jeep before sunset. We were all still tripping heavy, but the worst of the mental tripping was gone, and it was now primarily visual. My phone began ringing constantly as I regained cellular service. I had tons of messages from my girlfriend, and a large amount of social media notifications. Talking to her was a great relief and definitely helped put a band aid on my psyche until I could sort this all out.

We got into the jeep and began the long, cautious drive home, with bright street lights becoming overwhelming and a total inability to see where cars were as they created long, lasting motion trails. It somehow didn't turn me off from psychedelics permanently, but it utterly shattered all of my previously held philosophical beliefs and for the next week I was incredibly depressed and emotionless.",110123,21,LSD,3 hits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Journey Through My Mind,Greg,2013-09-13,2025-02-07,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 18,Very Highly Recommended,190.0,lb,"I had just received my package on Tuesday. I planned on tripping throughout an entire day, getting up in the early hours (5am) to dose one of the two hits I had purchased. I had trouble sleeping and I ended up only getting about 5 hours of sleep because of how excited I was. When I awoke at 5:30 I was more energetic and positive than ever, despite my lack of sleep. I grabbed some coffee, took some vitamin supplements and awaited for 6:00am because I figured it would be better to dose on the hour.
6:00am - Tasteless. Not even the slightest amount of any sort of bitterness or any other tastes. This was my first time ever trying the drug, but after extensive reading I knew this was a good thing. This put a smile on my face, I proceeded to take pictures of the tab on my tongue and anxiously awaited for the drug to kick in.
6:30-7:00 - I was started to get really anxious as I heard my Dad downstairs doing his morning routine getting ready to leave for work. I wasn't feeling anything yet, but I was listening intently during this time waiting to hear the front door open and close. I had no idea when he left because I usually slept in until 9:00, but I knew it was around 7:00-8:00.
7:05 - *WHAM* My whole house shook, I had been listening intently for this and I laughed to myself because it was so obvious what it was, my father had left. I knew that he was gone, but I slowly crept down the stairs to look outside just to make sure his car was gone, it was. Shortly after this at around 7:10 I decided to go for a walk, which looking back now was odd because I never planned on leaving the house at all, but I felt sober and decided it was a good idea.
7:20 - I make the first video of many on my phone documenting how I feel and my thoughts. I was feeling very giddy and positive, but I was starting to doubt if it would work. I thought it would kick in after an hour and at this point I was worrying I ate something that ruined the LSD. Regardless I laughed numerous amounts of times at things that were rather pretty dull, but still felt incredibly sober and unaffected, so after a short walk I headed home.
7:30 - I was back at home still feeling pretty normal except for the occasional laugh, and despite previous advice given to me to wait for the acid to kick in before smoking cannabis, I did it anyway. I went up to my room, loaded a bowl and smoked roughly .30g. I was sitting on my couch, blowing it out the window and I became extremely relaxed and euphoric. I smiled stupidly as I stared out the window I was blowing smoke out of. I simultaneously feared that somebody would see me, while not caring and taking in the outside world, it was really starting to become eerily beautiful.
8:00 - After I had smoked a bowl I decided that it would be a great idea to try some blueberries and have some coffee, two of my favorite foods. I proceeded to go downstairs at 7:45 and let two of our three dogs outside, because one of them was very old and didn't like the other dogs too much, so I let her stay in. I went into the kitchen and had to think for  a little bit about why I was in there. Once the thought finally hit me again, I got a glass, filled it with ice and got some coffee. I then had to recall what else I came downstairs for. I didn't think much of it, but I was having a very hard time holding onto thoughts and remembering what I was doing after literally seconds. I finally remembered the blueberries and brought them to the sink.
I looked down at the old dog and started talking to her a little bit, giving her small talk and laughing as I did so here and there. I decided it was time to wash the blueberries so I turned on the sink, opened the plastic container, and BAM! As the water ran through the container onto my hands beneath it, it felt extremely weird. I knew that this was the acid and I started absolutely dying, repeatedly saying 'Holy shit! Holy shit!' over and over. The water felt like slime and rainbows shot across my vision rapidly. I screamed to my phone that the acid had kicked in and it was 8:00, I was overjoyed. I set the blueberries down and just stared at my dog for a bit, I wondered if I should give her some blueberries, but ultimately decided against it. I brought my blueberries and coffee upstairs and knew that I just had to go on a walk. I grabbed some smokes and went on my second walk of the day.
8:25 - I started a voice recording on my phone and I didn't realize it then, but listening back I was having an incredibly hard time talking. I would say 2 or 3 words and then just stop and continue on another thought, then jump back to what I was originally saying, I was impossible to follow. I remark several times that my mind is 'going a thousand miles a minute, and I have vivid imagery coming and leaving my head rapidly'. I also go on to say that acid wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, and now that I've experienced it, it's much easier to grasp and understand. I also remark how incredibly similar I felt to being high on weed, but with much more enhanced effects.
I try to keep my voice recording on and pretend like I'm talking on the phone to somebody, but I was terrified/paranoid that somebody would hear me saying weird things as I walked past some houses on the way to a nearby park. In a later recording I state that 'walking through the neighborhood made me feel like I was an outsider, coming to a new tribe that nobody had ever made contact with, and I was their only experience with the outside world.' I wasn't uncomfortable, but I found it incredibly hard to muster any courage to say anything to the phone, I walked silently to the park.
I got to the park and went to the grass field where there was a big dip in the landscape and felt amazing. I had an overcoming feeling of 'oneness' with the universe, feeling connected with everything around me by one way or another. I felt an extremely intense urge to rip off all my clothes and run in the field
I had an overcoming feeling of 'oneness' with the universe, feeling connected with everything around me by one way or another. I felt an extremely intense urge to rip off all my clothes and run in the field
, but only for a second and I thought how weird it was that I felt that way. I looked around the park and the 2 or 3 people that were there made me incredibly uneasy. I wanted to stay as far away from them as possible, because I felt that they would know I was tripping if they heard me talking on the phone. This was upsetting because I was really feeling the peak of my high at this moment and wanted very badly to describe it, but I 'knew' I could not.
I walked back to my house after I realized that there was no possible way I could stay any longer and remain comfortable with my surroundings. I took a scenic route home and truly felt amazing. Seeing nature and constructions of humans was amazing. My mind was like a dial and it spun back and forth between thinking how people lived thousands of years ago with only nature to depend on, without supermarkets and present day inventions, while it would flip back over to the future and think about all the different technological advancements that were on the horizon of possibility. It was astounding how fast my mind was working.
9:00 - I document how I felt on the walk and proceed to smoke another two bowls. I remark that I feel 'groovy' in the sense that everything is moving in waves and that it all gels together. I talk about how beautiful it is outside, how great I feel, and what an amazing drug acid is. I listened to some music and really had an introspective experience. I was ready for some baggage to come up, but it was absolutely insane how much thought I put into everything. I would think in my head in a question/ answer format and then I realized I was doing this and started wondering if I thought this way all the time. I wondered if it was normal, or if it was some sort of social disorder where I talk to myself to satiate social needs. Looking back on it now, I was just pondering questions and trying to answer them, but my mind was delving incredibly fast into each and every thought I had, resulting in some bad ones sometimes, but it was easy to forget about it and go back to enjoying my trip.
I texted my friend for a little bit about how I was feeling and really just enjoyed my music along with the OEV's I was getting. Walls were morphing and looked like water with rippling waves cascading down gently around me, while my windows shined varying colors of green and red onto them. I was enjoying some music that I absolutely loved and was in a very happy and uplifting mind state.  My mind was like a rapid fire machine gun, constantly spitting out thought after thought, and once I captured a thought it would explode into millions of others. I described it as surfing through a music library through genres, looking at, hip-hop, jazz, RnB, Techno, and then all of a sudden I get to rock and decide I want to think about it and it explodes into metal, 70's rock, 80's rock, progressive, alternative, etc. Every possible way I could think about an idea or a conflict happened within a matter of seconds and before I knew it I was already thinking about the next thing or delving even deeper into ideas. It truly was like a roller coaster in my head.
10:00 - Hands down the absolute worst part of the trip. I was enjoying my time, eating blueberries and sipping on water/ coffee and I looked down at my phone to check the time and both my mother and father had texted me. I have never felt so much fear in my life. I calmed down a few seconds later, but seeing my dad's name and my mom's I thought that something extremely terrible had happened. I read my dad's text which said that my mom would be coming over soon to drop off some of my brothers things. I started to feel very anxious and scared that I wouldn't be able to hold any sort of conversation with her and she would immediately know something was up because my eyes were blood red from the weed I had smoked.
I quickly read my mom's text soon after and it said that she just left his stuff on the porch. I was worried somebody might have come and taken it (despite the fact that she literally texted me about a minute ago) so I rushed downstairs. I checked outside through three separate windows and realized that my mother and father were not there. I quickly unlocked the door, saw his stuff, took it inside, and locked the door as fast as humanly possible. I took it over to his desk and laid it down, then proceeded to my room where I had to calm myself down. About 10-20 minutes after I was back to feeling great again, but I easily saw a glimpse of how bad an acid trip can turn in a few seconds.
10:30 - From this point on the trip was admittedly a tad bit less enjoyable because I always had this overhanging feeling that at any moment another bad thing could happen, but I generally was always in a good mood. After this point my trip starts to kind of blur in my head, and I didn't really remember to record much after this point. I sat alone in my room, just doing various things, I tried watching some 'trippy' youtube videos, but ultimately found them all to be retarded and cheesy.
I then looked up Stephen Hawking's TED talk and proceeded to watch this. I enjoyed it very much, even though I had a difficult time understanding parts of it because I would zone out and think of other things, I enjoyed hearing about what he had to say. Thinking about dimensions and reality on acid was fantastic, and I was still having some pretty good visuals. The ad at the end of the TED talks video seemed to repeat itself twice, which I considered a time loop, but since I had read about this phenomena I just shrugged it off.
At some point I decided to go for my third and final walk and this one was by far the best and most relaxing. I walked around without any recording this time and it was much more enjoyable. I remember at precisely 11:00 I walked past some elderly people as I checked my phone and decided to say hi because I could literally feel that they were scared of me. I was wearing clothing that some would consider 'gangster' or 'hip-hop' and I felt the need to show them that not all people that dress like me are bad. I said 'Hi' and it startled them, but they quickly replied hi back and I felt much better. I later started laughing hilariously at this because of how dramatic they reacted, but ultimately happy that I said hi. I walked a very far distance for a long time and I sat down at various benches and took in the various OEV's and thoughts that ran through my head. I loved it and I wanted to just sit and bask in the beauty of the day, but felt that I couldn't and had to return home.
Soon after I was coming around to my house, I walked through the same scenic route I had taken every time back home and saw an 18 year old kid dressed in some 'Gangsta' clothes like me, with a rottweiler. At first I was somewhat scared and thought that I should ignore him, but as I got closer I felt the same uneasy presence I had felt with the elderly couple and decided to say hi to him as well. He replied back, and I realized that he was smoking marijuana and I could tell that he was put at ease by me simply saying hi. I felt great after this and once again took in the winding and beautiful path on the way back to my house and really enjoyed the world around me.
12:00 - I started a video and immediately said how I was pretty sure I was starting to come down. I still remember how remarkable it was that it felt like it was literally melting away, little by little. I wasn't seeing any OEV's or wavy walls anymore. At this point I played my drums, drew a little, and just relaxed, walking around my house at my leisure. I was starting to feel pretty groggy headed, but still capable of clear thought and cognitive function.
1:00 - I drew a little more, but soon felt uninterested.  I decided to make myself some food because even though I didn't feel hungry I could tell that I should have something to hold me over. I made some eggs and waffles and sat down to enjoy them. I was watching adventure time, but for the life of me could not understand what they were saying. I was trying to follow the plot and understand the words they were saying, but it was seriously like another language. I kept it on as it was pleasing on the eyes to watch. At this point my sister randomly came home and started yelling. I don't know why, but this didn't bother me at all. I knew that she wouldn't come talk to me and that she would leave the house soon, but the fear I felt when my parents texted me was nowhere to be found. I don't know why I wasn't scared and even at that moment I recalled it being odd that I wasn't afraid at all, but I didn't think on it long and finished my meal soon after.
2:00 - I would consider this the point where I stopped really 'tripping'. I had a raging headache which I could only describe as my brain being 'overheated' and needing to cool down. I laid down in my bed, not even really tired, but unable to think about anything pleasurable to do I figured I should relax. I closed my eyes and had some minor CEV's, but soon fell asleep and woke up later at about 3:00 and proceeded to just lie there. My head was really foggy and hurt quite a bit, I was irritable and felt pretty bad to be honest. I personally would attribute this to my lack of sleep because I have read that coming off LSD it is hard to sleep and I passed right the fuck out, so I feel next time I will try to get more sleep. Other than that, I was just cranky the rest of the day, and my family members were constantly asking me if there was something wrong because I looked depressed. I felt groggy and uninspired to talk or do anything, but never depressed. I explained this to them as best I could and proceeded to stay quiet. I figure there's probably better ways to come off a trip, but this was really my only option.
[Epilogue]  Later at night I had some coffee and it helped my headache a bit, but it mostly lasted from about 3:00pm to 12:00am. I talked with my friend that I texted before and I could tell that I was saying things differently and much better at holding a consistent conversation. I even suggested some things that he and I do with our lives that he remarked was a 'very good idea' and thought that I had a good outlook on life. He wouldn't believe me if I told him, but I personally think it's because of my experience with acid. I don't feel different personally, but I feel that after having deeply thought about my innermost struggles, I am more confident in myself and therefore more happy. I also believe that acid had an effect on my conversationalism, because I was saying things that I consciously realized I never said, and my friend who regularly used 1 or 2 sentence responses, was writing me back in paragraphs. I felt great about this (despite my headache).
I wrote all of this the day after so I believe this in addition to my recordings is the best possible way I could've remembered the trip. A lot of it is still fresh in my head and what I recorded helped me really nail down the time certain events happened. I felt that in some way it was nice that I had a way to share my revelations, but looking back on the recordings, they seem silly, and my best memories of the trip were unrecorded. I am glad I got to accurately document my first experience ever, but I fear that it may have interfered with my trip.
OEV - Walls were literally like water, the sunlight coming through the windows was green and red, when I looked at the sidewalk it looked like there was graffiti all over it, staring outside into my backyard everything was extremely vibrant and the furniture outside literally flashed rainbow colors and started flipping in spirals, things would appear that I ultimately considered not real (people, cars, etc.) Scenic route back to my house seemed to go on forever, even when I clearly saw the ending. Arrows pointing towards the frame of my glasses when I put them on.
CEV - Various objects flying at me, things morphing and shape shifting, my CEV's were ultimately weak because I kept my eyes open the entire trip.
Auditory Hallucinations - I frequently heard various things that sounded much more intense or closer than they really were. I would frequently hear somebody say something that I couldn't have possibly heard (i.e. alone in my room, I would hear random words spoken quickly despite the fact I was alone in silence). Various songs/ musical snippets sometimes played out for a few seconds. My hearing was enhanced like crazy, I could clearly see in my head where everything was that was making sound, which made the hallucinations more intense.
Thanks for reading my trip report and be sure to do your research!

Life Changing Encounter with The Other,mindexplorer,2010-09-13,2012-03-16,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 20,Very Highly Recommended,135.0,lb,"I decided to fast for 30 hours before participating in the ceremony. I knew that vomiting was inevitable, and I had been told that fasting would give me a stronger experience. I had pretty bad altitude sickness because I had just arrived in Cusco (elevation 3326 m), so it wasn’t hard to fast. At sunset, we took an old-school volkswagon beetle up to the top of one of the hills surrounding Cusco. We entered a fairly spacious hut; three bed-mats with plenty of blankets were lined up in front of an altar. I remember having a conversation with the Curanderismo while he was preparing for the long night ahead. I distinctly remember him saying: “Ayahuasca no es una droga. Ayahuasca es La Medecina.” That resounded in me.
He began the ceremony by lighting a candle inside of a large frame with holes running along the sides. This gave the room an eerie glow, as the candle flickered and projected shadows along the walls. He then proceded to fill his mouth with coca leaves, tucking them under his lip as he chanted a ritual song. Tobacco and coca are sacred to the Curaderismos, for they allow contact with the spirits. He then pulled out an empty, plastic water bottle filled with some dark fluid, the Ayahuasca. He blessed the Ayahausca with a prayer, then blew over the top of the bottle before pouring the liquid into small, ceramic glasses. He handed each of us the drink, then gave us individual blessings by blowing tobacco smoke all over us. He told me to drink it all at once. It tasted like some strong, exotic, bitter wine, but it wasn’t nearly as disgusting as I had expected. I was pleased by this.
The purge happened after about 20 minutes. It didn’t last long. After I was certain that all of the Ayahuasca had left me, I got comfortable and laid down. There were some windows on the thatched roof, which allowed me to see the night sky. When I closed my eyes, I began to see geometrical patterns, fractals actually, all across my visual field. Then I felt a presence, as if I was surrounded by dozens of people. They were there to comfort me, to calm me down, and I began to feel wonderful. I heard, or possibly felt, a woman assure me that everything was going to be ok, and she beckoned me to come with her into the spirit world. She felt very motherly, which evokes images of “mother earth” or “panchamama”, as they say in Quechua. Then a red light appeared which jolted me up. The Curanderismo was staring straight at me, and then he asked me, “You O.K., (x)?”  He would ask me that question throughout the entire night. It’s actually a joke I still have with one of my friends who was there with me. Even when I was uncontrollably hallucinating, I would still respond “si”. It almost amused me, because I would always have to think for few seconds, “Am I ok?” I always was, and I’m very glad he would ask. There were some difficult situations that he helped me through later in the night. Ayahuasca should never be used without a shaman.
The Ayahuascero played sacred songs, ancient songs, beautiful in their own right, but not comparable to anything I had ever heard before, except for maybe the chanting of Chasidic rabbis. He used drums and flutes and vocal intonations to guide our experiences. The shaman uses these auditory signals purposefully to evoke visual imagery within the participants. The songs, or Icarus, convey information, stories, about their ancestors. My visions would consist of jungles and jaguars and hunts and feasts and people, and it reminded me of the Torah, just their jungle version of it. For hours he was consistently able to provoke this imagery. I believe this may represent a novel form of communication that has yet to be studied by modern science. It’s worthy of investigation.
During the first 3-4 hours, I came into direct contact with multiple hyperdimensional entities, also known as spirits or angels. However, there were many different types of entities I encountered, and the differences must be addressed in order to understand the phenomenon. Some spirits had human qualities, which ranged from ordinary to powerful shamans. I remember one entity had a very strong presence; the Ayahuascero became silent, and the candle began flickering furiously when the spirit entered the room. Many of the spirits would enter my body, and I could feel them; I felt like most of them were healing me, although some would speak to me in exotic languages that I couldn’t understand. Some spirits were not human at all, and if I were to guess, I would say they were plant spirits. I could just tell. Some spirits seemed like they were responsible for our existence, as if they played a role in the unfolding of the present moment. At first, my reaction to these spirits was that this was ridiculous, that they must just be hallucinations. But after about an hour of observing them, and scrutinizing them, I came to the rational, semi-empirical conclusion that they were real. They passed all of my cognitive tests for what spirits would actually look like if they were real, by that I mean they were far stranger than anything I could have ever imagined to be real. However, I must stress that there are no words adequate in describing them, and most of them were felt, not necessarily seen, in the traditional sense at least. It’s just one of those things that may sound ludicrous to somebody reading this, but makes perfect sense if you actually experience it.
At some point I realized that my experience was over. It went by too quickly. I hadn’t seen my spirit animal, I hadn’t had an out of body experience, I hadn’t felt the presence God, I had just interacted with these spirits that showed me random shit. That was it. But what insights had I gained? It was a cool experience and all, but not the most profound experience of my life. I was a little disappointed. However, the Curanderismo noticed this. He laughed and said I could always just drink more; he said I would fully enter the spirit world if I drank more. I was a little nervous about that prospect, and went into the bathroom to fully think it over. In the end, I realized that I might not have the opportunity to do this again.
I drank the second glass of ayahuasca. I had no idea what was about to happen. While I was waiting for the ayahuasca to take effect, I could hear what sounded like a few dozen dogs right outside of our hut. In Cusco, dogs travel in packs; they aren’t confined to the backyards of their owners. They began to growl, and soon a huge fight broke out between two of the dogs. The intensity of this situation, with over a dozen dogs barking and growling at one another, made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Then the purge happened, and I was immediately catapulted into the psychedelic realm. I kept on thinking to myself: “Why did I drink it again?”  “This is too powerful.” “What is happening to me?” “Where did the spirits go?” “Why is the shaman silent?”
I heard this loud noise, like somebody was turning a nob inside of my head that controlled all of the possible frequencies of sound. I also began to enter these extraordinary visual realms, and then immediately forget what happened. Visions were flowing so fast that I couldn’t comprehend anything. However, the experience came in waves, and when I was aware enough to think about my situation, I realized that I was experiencing my subconscious. I began to analyze myself, and I felt like I was at the cusp of realizing what a thought was. Then I realized it was a paradox, how can a thought be used to understand what thoughts are? I also had many personal realizations about life, my family, and myself. I understood that our time on Earth was finite.
At some point the dogs stopped fighting, and I became calm again. I laid down, and looked through the roof at one of the stars. At this point, I could understand the dogs. Communication with animals is definitely possible. That sounds really weird, but I could literally understand and empathize, on a deep emotional level, the information that the dogs were conveying in their howls. This sparked profound realizations. I realized that on a fundamental level, all conscious entities were the same. The only differences between our consciousness, and the consciousness of dogs, were merely different wavelengths within a greater medium.
Upon this realization, my vision became engulfed with a white light. The light was so bright and beautiful that I began to uncontrollably cry. I knew that I was experiencing the same white light people describe upon death. It was the source of all consciousness. It was omnipresent, eternal, and about as close to a description of God as you can get. This must be God. I understood how all life, and the universe, was connected by fractals in this hyperdimensional membrane. I felt like my soul had connected to an ocean made of light, and tears flowed down my cheeks as I saw the entire universe , galaxies and all.
I could feel the ayahuasca coursing throughout my veins. I noticed that I couldn’t feel my hands; my body slowly became numb. I accepted God, in all of his glory, and prayed that I would be safe. There were no entities to guide me this time.
Very soon I had no body. I just was. Complete and utter transcendence. But I could still see, which puzzled me, because I had no eyes. I actually began to float out of my body, and into the room. I could see my life-less body, laying down, with my hands across my chest. I could see the shaman, and my two friends, (Y) was crouched in the fetal position. But there was also this violet light, and it seemed to be coming out of my body; the room was filled with this light. I wasn’t scared because I knew that out-of-body experiences are common on ayahausca, but I never thought it would feel this real. The realization that I had become some sort of hyperdimensional entity freaked me out. What if I never returned to my body? Was I dead? Immediately, I returned back to my body after thinking those thoughts. I was both filled with relief, that I was alive, and regret, that I hadn’t gone further into the spirit realm. However, my body was still fairly numb, and raising my hands gave me the sensation of flying through some ethereal realm.
Ayahuasca is gentle. The effects just slowly taper off, and there’s a calm afterglow. I had no desire to return to that realm. I got what I had come for. It’s amazing how quickly you forget what the experience was like. Within a few hours, I didn’t even have the ability to imagine what I had just felt. My strong convictions about the existence of God and Spirits declined, but at the same time, I knew that while I was experiencing it, my core self, was there. I trust myself, and I trust my judgement, even on Ayahuasca. I realized that there is legitimacy in spirituality. Even if God doesn’t exist, I know that God is a perception that people have the potential to have. At least the stories aren’t completely based in bullshit. I feel like ayahuasca prepares you for death as well. I am no longer afraid of death. We will all eventually die. It takes away the mystery; allows you to at least imagine what the afterlife might be like. What’s the point of believing nothing happens after death anyway? It’s fucking depressing.
Reflecting upon my experience, I am no longer the same person. First of all, the Ayahuasca literally did heal me of certain gastrointestinal discomforts that I had had since first grade. I feel much more in touch with my body as well. I no longer drink alcohol; I have absolutely no desire to use drugs for temporary pleasure. I exercise on a daily basis. I feel as if my life actually has a purpose, and I can’t waste any time. I need to live in the moment, and just have as many experiences as I can. I’ve never felt more happy, and content with my existence. I’m excited about what’s to come; about where my life’s journey will take me next. There is still so much we have left to learn. We can never forget that.",91566,52291,Ayahuasca,,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Light,Evlove,2001-09-13,2001-04-28,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: Not Given,Very Highly Recommended,150.0,lb,"It was friday night, Shabbos.  My girlfriend E and I were visiting my parents' home at a time no one else was there.  This was a very safe and comforting place.
Before the tea, I was already filled with excitement and awe about the upcoming sacrament.  It was as though the insight was beginning before the ingestion.  E was pretty excited, but also pretty anxious about la purga.  Her nausea also began a little before the ingestion.
The Strength:
I took out the extracted material (see below for prep info), which was separated into the Strength(caapi) and the Light(viridis).  We opted to take the Strength by rolling the extract into balls and swallowing with water, which was pretty easy.
We then decided to take a walk up to a park near my house.  The sun was setting and it was drizzling a little outside, but it was a very pleasing drizzle.  When we got to the park, I started noticing birds everywhere.  Not that there were a lot of birds, rather I happened to connect with and notice every bird within my immediate surroundings effortlessly (or intentionally on their part). I took this as a very good sign.  E and I both didn't notice any overt effects aside from the a slight rippling of the trees that was more than usual.  As we walked back, E said she did feel different, but that it was difficult to explain.  However, when I questioned her a little more she said that she felt like the trees were walking with us or we were making the world move while we were staying still.  This instantly reminded of Ken Wilber's description of One Taste while running, which seemed to give E a sense of validity to her experience.
The Light:
When we got back home, E said that being inside forced her awareness inside and this forced her to focuss on how strange her body felt.  Within minutes she was hovering over the toilet, purging a small meal she had eaten two hours previously.  Still feeling sick, she asked if we could postpone taking the light a little so she could lay down.  I brought her to a dark bedroom and began to give her a mix of massage and reiki.  After about fifteen minutes, E said she was ready and we went to the dining room.
One candle was lit as we sat face to face at the dining room table. The Light filled two glass mugs (~6 oz. each) and looked like a dark cappuccino.  We both began to drink the light, E gulping quickly while I sipped it slowly.  Immediately, E jumped up and threw up on the floor.  I went to help her and clean up and then I went back to finish the tea.  I told E that I would leave a little so that she could try again later.  In total I think I drank about 70% of the intended dose.
We went back outside and started walking to a different park.  E was a little dissapointed that she hadn't been able to keep any of the Light down and was very busy asking me to describe my experience.  At first, it was difficult to find something happening until I sat down and closed my eyes.  At this point (maybe ten minutes after the Light) I could get into a deep meditative place easily.  Then I openned my eyes and realized that things were not as they usually are anymore.
We left the park and strolled through the neighborhoods.  I started to notice cats in a lot of the windows in a very similar way that I was noticing birds before.  As we walked, I experienced incredible time and space dilation as one block seemed to take forever to walk. Then I started to see the Light as an undenyable glowing off my sweat shirt.
We returned home, but we stayed outside.  I started to tell E all kinds of stories about my backyard and how I would play in the creek on this and that rock.  I became flooded with childhood memories and I began to re-live some of the imaginary games I used to play.  I was amazed at the detail and reality of the memories and how I had gone so long without accessing them.
We sat down on a bench and I rested my head on E's shoulder.  I knew she wasn't experiencing the light like I was, but she was still incredibly with me and loving.  I asked her to talk to me and she began to talk about a presentation she did in a film class.  As she described the plot line I would be flooded with imagery and emotions about little moments in the story.  One in particular that stands out revolved around sex and all of my feelings, memories and attitudes towards sex.
Then, a dog of Light approached me on my left side.  It's not quite clear whether I could see him better with my eyes open or shut, but I knew he was a creature of the Light.  I kept thinking about the idea of making contact and how I could feel this creature and communicate with him (I mean, the same as you can communicate with a real dog).  It was nice.
I then noticed electric, flashing light, neon sign, cartoon, lighting bolt, LSD types of imagery.  Media stuff, video games, commercials, sky scapers, glitter, technology etc.  and I wanted to move to a more natural type of experience beyond all this stuff.  And slowly behind the Time Square, Las Vegas flashings, I found the forest and the soul of the forest life, but these digital, man-made, archetypes kept coming into my awareness.
La Purga
We headed inside and all of the sudden it came to me very matter of factly, 'I have to throw up.'  My head over the bowl, I began to see disgusting images of blood and dirt and puss and dead things and remebered being in high school and worrying about how acne made me look ugly.  All of these ugly thoughts of myself and all of the things I felt guilty about, I regretted doing, all of my self directed negativity was concentrated into every heave into the puke filled water.
(A voice in my head said, 'That was great.')
After that, I found myself, clean and pure, new and innocent.  I sat up on the bathroom floor and I was an enlightened prince sitting in a field of bright green grass on a sunny day.  I was glowing from head to toe and I realized that this is who I always am and that all that junk in the toilet is just a self imposed illusion.  I felt fine with leaving it there.  I soon noticed E by my side and she was my princess.  It was beautiful...
But we were on the bathroom floor with a toilet covered in puke, so I got up.  E cleaned up this one as I went to lie down under a blacket on the couch.  The electric patterns came back and this time I just accepted them as part of me, as natural.  I accepted that my thoughts and rationality and the video game of life included the electricity, included the media, computers and information and that these are natural as well.  They quickly started to give way and move into something I really don't have a good language for...
It was a journey...E suggested we go upstairs and lie on a bed.  she was still just feeling sick, no vision no light.  As I lay with her, I was traveling and there was just so much I cannot begin to talk about it, but this was the heart of the journey.  At one point I got up to do a great round of Tai Chi.  And then we were just laying there.
I would feel myself through E and see myself as her.  I felt her holding on to the sickness, tensing up.  At this point, I suggested that we finish the Light and get her through this sickness.  She groaned and proposed that we have some marijuana first.  A couple breaths brought me in touch with this ally and then we headed downstairs.
I told her to just face the sickness and watch it dissolve.  I said, 'You'll drink this Light and then you will throw up and then it will be over.'  A strange kind of calm came over her and she drank the Light and then threw it right up and then she was cured.  She took on a glowing smile and couldn't believe she had spent so much time holding on to the sickness, which revealed itself to be of little substance.  She smiled so beautifully.
I also drank some more light, but this did not manifest as anything as it was probably too late after the Strength...(~3.5 hours)  The two of us went upstairs and I shared some of my experience.  Then we drifted to sleep easily and peacefully.
Preparation:
(via HCl method-during this dream I often thought about how effective this method is)
~105 grams of whole leaf peruvian Psychotria viridis were placed in a large pyrex pot with britta water and a small amount of muratic acid (pH ~4.5).  This was heated to a simmering/boiling temperature for about 2 hours stirring occationally with a wooden spoon.  This was filtered with a t-shirt and placed in another pyrex pot, which was set to boil to reduce volume.  Then the leaves were soaked again in britta water + muratic acid (pH ~4.5) and heated for an hour, then filtered and combined with the other solution.  One last wash was done to the leaves and then combined to the reduction pot.  When the liquid in the pot was down to about 6 oz. it was poured into a pyrex dish with syran wrap covering the bottom.  This was placed into an oven set at 220 degrees for two hours.  I then turned the oven off, but let it sit over night in the cooling oven.  When I awoke, I would turn the oven on for a little and then off letting it sit.  It stayed in the off/on oven for about two days (on for one hour/off for eight to twelve) and this succesfully took out all of the water and acid leaving a hard extract which could easily be recovered by lifting the syran wrap.
~65 grams of Banisteriopsis caapi were prepared in exactly the same way, except the vine was first beaten and shredded with a hammer and knife before the brewing began.  The caapi resulted a thick tarlike extract which could be rolled into balls.
Add hot water to these extracts and you've got tea.",6520,119483,Banisteriopsis caapi,30 g,oral,Psychotria viridis,40 g,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
