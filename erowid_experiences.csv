Death by Astonishment,Outis,2023-09-13,2025-03-02,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 47,Very Highly Recommended,175.0,lb,"There are infinite ways to begin this narrative, just as I’ve learned today that there are infinite possible forms in this never-ending universe. I began writing this report only a few hours after the conclusion of my first (and possibly my last) psilocybin therapy session on June 20, 2023. I say “last” not because it was bad, but because another one, at this moment, seems unnecessary: the message was abundantly clear and overwhelming.
I can still feel lingering physical effects (e.g., hearing chirping birds that aren’t there), and I am certain the psychological and emotional effects will endure – some perhaps for the rest of my life. According to my guide (my teacher, brother, and friend), I had a “big experience” with an overpowering sense of “non-dual” reality. During the journey itself, I labelled what I felt, “dying,” but by that point, all labels, categories, and concepts had no meaning. Meaning itself didn’t seem important anymore. Nothing seemed important; importance is just a concept, like all the other concepts we use in this world to help us do things. I simply surrendered to the infinite bliss of total self-dissolution.
Whatever one might call it, it has been the most profound experience of my life. I have just completed the 30-question Mystical Experience Questionnaire (a few hours after the journey), and further to my amazement, all my answers are fives, the highest number on the scale.
Background
I am a 47-year-old who’s been interested in psychedelics since first encountering the work of Terence McKenna as a teenager. My experience with mind-altering substances has been minimal: routine caffeine and alcohol, as well as some light and very infrequent cannabis use. In a few cases, anxiety, depersonalization, and derealization hung on long after consuming strains high in THC, leading me to mostly avoid cannabis. In recent years, I have done five IM ketamine treatments in clinical settings. These treatments improved my openheartedness, reduced my fear of psychedelics, and increased my interest in psilocybin, which the voters in my U.S. state legalized in 2022.
Although I was reared by parents who practiced spiritual traditions, I do not consider myself a spiritual person. In fact, I tend to silently scoff at people’s experiences of the mystical and divine. My practices involve hikes in the mountains and occasionally staring in wonder at the clouds and stars. I tilt toward rational, scientific, and analytical thinking. However, my interest in psychedelics and mysticism (through commentators including Watts, McKenna, Dass, Campbell, etc.) demonstrates a simultaneous interest in the ineffable, which I had never personally experienced beyond a few fleeting encounters with clairvoyance and premonition. I have long been skeptical that ineffable experience was worth talking about, since to be made meaningful, it must be brought into the realm of language. In hindsight, and according to my guide, this philosophical framework, somewhat paradoxically, may have helped me better understand and integrate what I experienced.
Preparation, Set, and Setting
I am six-feet tall, 175 pounds, and aside from chronic back pain, fairly healthy. If I have suffered severe trauma in my life, I am unaware of it. I have a general sense of wellbeing and mostly positive self-regard. My intentions were to use this experience to satisfy a lifelong and intense curiosity, as well as a sense of personal and professional obligation to try this newly decriminalized medicine. I wanted to see if doing so might impart some knowledge or self-realization (hat tip Michael Pollan), and I wanted to finally overcome my fear of psychedelics. The three words I wanted to remember during the journey were: surrender, trust, and safety.
The setting was my home, with a small sofa-bed used for the session. My guide measured and prepared a tea of 3-grams of Ghost and Steel Magnolia mushrooms. We sat in ceremony, and then I drank the mixture out of a cup I’d made. The single dose was taken at approximately 10:30 am. It tasted surprisingly good, reminding me of shitake mushroom soup. My guide sat next to me, close enough to hold my hand, which he did for nearly the entirety of the journey once it intensified.
Having such a profound experience (as I describe below) on 3-grams of mushrooms may seem unusual, but I am sensitive to medicines in general, and I had also fasted for 48-hours before the experience (nothing but water). My guide told me after the session that he would have liked to have known about my fast. I presume it might have helped him better gauge the likely effects and duration of my dose.
Guide’s Notes
It is cliché that nothing can fully prepare someone for the experience of ego-death on a dose of psychedelic mushrooms (although careful preparation is still absolutely needed). I was neither seeking nor expecting the death of my ego. I didn’t think it was even possible on three grams. But I can report that my experience was highly similar to other ego-dissolving trip reports I have read/heard. In fact, I learned today that most of the clichés about the psilocybin experience are true: visions of figures, images, and animals (in my case, tiki gods, Indonesian Batik patterns, and benevolent serpents); colors and geometry of unbelievable complexity and beauty. I laughingly reported to my guide: “I can see ultraviolet now!”; unity with all beings and all times; no self-other distinction; complete surrender of all categories and concepts (especially self and time); and the feeling of being part of the never-ending multiplicity of the blissful unfolding of forever. Clearly, the previous sentence also reveals the accuracy of the cliché that words fail to adequately capture the experience. I knew that truism intellectually before today, but I understand and feel its accuracy differently now. During the journey, feelings of overwhelming love were accompanied by unending awe and astonishment, feelings that I’d heard others talk about on countless
video trip reports I’d watched. After today, I better understand these reports and find myself chuckling at instances where I now exclaim, when watching: “Yes!” “Me too!” or “I know!”
What follows is a transcript based on my guide’s notes. Reading this transcript is, to me, astonishing. I would not believe this journey happened if it were not for both my guide’s notes and my fading recollections. I have not tried to interpret much of what I said. No interpretation seems needed.
About 45-minutes into the journey, the blackness of my eye mask became a screen for flowing colors: iridescent, shimmering, and self-transforming rainbows abounded. These were undoubtably shaped by the songs from the album, “Migration,” by Peter Kater and R. Carlos Nakai, which my guide selected for my journey. Acknowledging the visuals, he suggested going deeper. I surrendered even more to “mama mushroom.”
I began sobbing, thinking of the intense love I felt from, and for, my mother. “She loved me so much!” I exclaimed. “When I was a baby, she never let me cry … I love my son the same way my mama loved me,” I said, through tears.
My guide asked me if I thought I would want a booster dose. I was surprised, because it seemed very early in the journey, and the effects were much gentler than 100-mgs of ketamine (which I’d tired before). I was tempted for a moment to say “yes” to the booster, but having mentioned my mother, I felt she would have wanted her “baby boy” to stay safe, and since safety was one of my three words for the journey, I declined the booster dose. I’m glad I did because what then occurred was overwhelming. I am sure I would have been unable to stand any more medicine.
My thoughts returned to my mother, who is elderly and in poor health. “I love you so much,” I burbled through my tears. “You kept me warm and safe, and I want you to be warm and safe. I want you to be okay,” I cried. I then decided to release my mom and continue to move through the beautiful, soothing, breathing colors. The musical lightshow in my mind incorporated visions of meandering, benevolent serpents.
Then, I confronted before me: “something.” Feeling “infinite serenity and peacefulness,” I asked out loud, “What is it?” I can now barely see it in my mind’s eye,
an infinitely transformable, fluid, multi-dimensional column or pillar of everything imaginable. Whatever can be imagined rises to its surface. I saw arising on the edge of it something that I knew to be “me,” the human me that was born, is having this material existence, and that will one day die and return to “it.” I was certain that this “thing,” whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished.
I was certain that this “thing,” whatever it was, was everything. There was nothing above or below it, in front or behind it, before or after it. It just existed. It was existence. I was utterly astonished.
I was in awe. My guide recorded my utterances:
“I’m astounded!”
“I had no idea… the infinite possibilities.”
“Infinite combinations, forever. Forever!”
“Whatever it is, I see it.”
“Infinite. Infinite. Infinitely changing.”
“I’m from that. I popped out [of it]. I am one of those changes.”
“My mom, she loved me. I feel it. I am sooo lucky to be bathed in that love.”
“[It] is really fucking infinite! I am persuaded! I am astonished! I. Am. In. Awe!”
“There is no boundary between us. You are me, and I am you.”
“I’ll leave that pain behind. It’s back there.”
“You want to show me that? Ok… [a moment later] It’s sooo beautiful! Really!?! [sobbing through tears] I. Am. Astonished!!!”
“I understand. I get it. Thank you!” [laughing and sobbing through more tears]
“Oh. My. God. The ecstasy!!!
“I really am!?! Ok. It’s sooo much. I’m from there!?! Ok.” [laughter]
“Oh. My. God!”
“Isn’t it great!?!” It’s fucking great!!! Put that in the book, I say: “It’s fucking great!!!”’ There’s your testimonial!”
“There is no difference.”
“I cannot believe how good it feels. Unbelievably blessed.”
“I want to do for You. [anguish] I am just so grateful. What do you want me to do, and I will do it. [sobbing] Of course, I will… just show me what to do.”
“It says, ‘just do what you’re doing.’”
“That’s it!?! That’s it, huh? Just bathe in it forever? [smiling] Really? Okay.”
“Why are you so nice to me? I asked you to be [nice to me], that’s true. Thank you. It feels so good.”
“It wants me to tell you, there is no ‘you.’”
“We all go here? Really!?! Okay. Really!?! Because right here is sooo good. I am overwhelmed with the goodness of it all. I am convinced of the overwhelming goodness of it all. If I live here forever, I am fine with it! Just put an exclamation point on the page [and close the book]. [laughter]
“[It] is beyond the discourse. The rapture.”
“You’ve convinced me.”
“Shall we stay here?”
“It said it gave me this body as a gift, to feel these things.”
“‘Oh, we’ll convince you’ [it says]. It’s So. Much. Love! Oh. My. God. The ECSTACY!!! Soothing, basking in it. Eternal bliss.”
“Don’t you [people on Earth] want to try this never-ending bliss, forever? [laughing] It’s right here [in a mushroom, right behind your eyelids, or in front of your nose]. Forever. Unbelievable.” [laughing]
“I don’t understand why anybody would be frightened of it, ever. There is nothing to be afraid of. It’s just pure, never-ending bliss forever.” [laughter, smiling]
“Something died, and I left it behind.”
“It is showing me that I am part of this. I’m in bliss forever. Oh. My. God. It’s showing me.”
“This is where we all end up. ‘Are you ok with it [it is asking me]’? Yes! Why wouldn’t I be ok with it!?!” [laughing]
“It’s beyond any kind of rational understanding or any concepts of any kind.”
“We are love and light and bliss forever. Oh my God, the rapture is so glorious.”
[I ask for the time, and it is 1:15 pm]. “I don’t even know what that means.” [time] [laughter]
“‘Here monkey [human, it is saying], let me show you a little of this.’ I can’t explain it. The Infinite.”
“You can’t bring any of it back [lamenting]. [It’s] ineffable.”
“There is no ‘there’ or ‘out there.’”
“I died.”
[after a period of silence, when my guide asked how I was doing] “I just died and am in peace.”
“I don’t know who I am.”
“There is no boundary between whatever it is and us. We are it. We are that. Whatever it is.”
[coming to just a bit from the effects of the medicine. Removing my eye mask] “I don’t know where I was. I don’t know what a body is. I went to a realm that is beyond everything. I can see how people say you are one with God. Every category and every boundary are obliterated. I can’t understand what “that” is. [But] I am no longer afraid of death. [It] is beyond categories or concepts. Why would anyone want to be born [separated from it]? I don’t know if I will ever come back [to Earth]. Part of me doesn’t want to come back. There are no pains [in that place] in my body. You just get to be whatever ‘that’ is for eternity. Then you wake up. Whatever that was, there, it’s everything. Always. Forever.”
[struggling to return from the medicine] “There is a knowing [in my mind] or a part of me that knows I exist [as a human on Earth]. I am aware of having a body, but I am just existence. Is it ok to go back [to the endless non-place]? I guess I will just exist here now [in the endless non-place].”
[coming too even more now from the medicine] “I don’t know what anything means anymore. But some part of me knows that I’m a primate that needs water. [drinks water] There are days, sun, stars, existence [on Earth]? Holy shit! There is something called ‘reality’ that I know I will want to attend to. You can stop caring about being ‘normal.’ Normal was overrated.”
[the subsequent exchanges were not recorded, but I was struggling with my identity and the nature of reality for about an hour – see “Cautions” below.]
Unasked Questions Answered
I want to make it clear that I did not consume psilocybin with an intent to gain answers to existential or metaphysical questions. Yet, the medicine delivered “news” that cannot be ignored.
I feel like a snake that has shed its skin - a man reborn on June 20, 2023. I feel like I can take from old “me” that which is useful and now leave behind all those memories, habits of mind, and concerns that no longer serve.
Part of me wishes I had come to this transformation earlier in my life, but the truth is, I probably wasn’t ready. I undertook this journey at an apex in my professional and personal life, which likely accounts for the strong, positive experience I had. My Living Will had been written earlier, my “one good book” had been finished, and I was prepared to die of a heart attack or suffer psychosis. I was free to fully let go.
I now believe that non-discursive, ineffable experience is possible. In fact, I would encourage any skeptic of mysticism or spirituality, like me, to try an ego-dissolving dose of psylocibin. I would challenge that person to maintain their skepticism when confronted with their experience.
I now feel like I know where we “go” when we die. I did not seek to know this, but I have seen and felt what I believed to be the source of all existence, and you and me and everything we can sense are the material expressions of its timeless, unending transformation and expression. I believe the self that I call “me” materially emerged from this source when I was conceived about nine months before my birth. When I die, my consciousness will return to this source in a way that may be like what I felt during my psilocybin journey. Another experience of “me” (as a rock, ant, bird, human, or alien, etc.) may be expressed again in some other time or material plane of existence, or not, I really don’t know. However, I believe everyone I have known, and everything in this universe, emerged from this same source and are just expressions of it. In that way, we are all connected and all the same. Materially, we are all created from the same dust of stars, and existence is just each atom of each speck of dust. I now better understand what Alan Watts meant when quoting Hindu text that declared, “You are That!”
Where does this existence reside? Does it encompass the distant reaches of space, is it inside our brain, just behind our eyelids, or in the smallest constituent quark of an atom? My answer is “Yes” and “I don’t know.” I am a mere hominid who consumed psilocybin and experienced something that cannot be explained in words or other symbols. While I have seen art that resembles aspects of what I saw and felt, it does not fully capture the astonishing awe and reverence that occurred while feeling the soothingly undulating, forever-transforming source of all existence, of which I am, and all things are, expressions separated only while we are experiencing our various material forms.
Do I believe in God now? If anyone wants to label what I saw and felt “God,” I won’t object. But I won’t use that word because it’s just a word (a highly loaded one), and words have no meaning in the place I experienced. I believe I saw or experienced the source of all existence. But I happily concede that I could have been merely hallucinating on mushrooms.
Did I go “full hippie,” and can I see God in a cabbage now? I can appreciate that everything is an expression of the source of all creation, but a cabbage isn’t the source, it’s a material expression of the source (and good in stir-fry). No, I do not suddenly believe in astrology, teleportation, past lives, astral projection, ghosts, or other such phenomena beyond them being amusing and sometimes useful concepts in our world.
What is the purpose of life? I don’t know the purpose of anyone else’s life. I begged the source of all existence to tell me how I could “give back” for all the blessings I’ve had in mine. It only told me to keep doing what I’m doing. I said, “That’s it?” I couldn’t believe it. “Why are you so nice to me?” I asked? “It’s true, I asked you to be nice to me. Thank you,” I said. I don’t understand it all, but I feel mostly relieved of the burden to keep asking myself what I should be doing to give back – the answer to that question, I know now, continually unfolds inside my heart. I can listen any time.
I called my mom sometime after my journey to tell her again how much I love her, and how I know (maybe more than ever) how much she loved/ loves me. It was a beautiful conversation that probably would not have occurred otherwise.
Two days after my journey, I can see some lingering effects, including an ability to better choose how I want to respond to people and situations around me. I find it easier to say “with love” in texts and emails to friends, and I feel more open and compassionate. My usual irritation with people and processes has, thankfully, eased. Yet, there is nothing remaining of the blissful astonishment I felt during my journey.
I am still in a bit of shock about what happened to me. My skepticism is returning, but I cannot deny that I said and felt these things. In that way, I guess, I remain astonished.
Don’t let a 3-gram dose fool you: I completely dissolved. A guide should be someone absolutely trusted with one’s life and sanity. More than five hours after my trip had begun, I felt I had “returned” from wherever I had gone. I no longer had any visual hallucinations or feelings of being “under” the influence of a psychedelic compound. The physical reality of my home had returned to how it always looked and felt. However, I was absolutely convinced that I had died and that whoever “I” was before the experience no longer existed and that the new person I had become would need to reconstruct an identity and relationships from total scratch. I believed I could probably do this with great effort, but I was anxious about doing so. Sensing my unease, my guide walked me to the area of my home where I keep photos of my loved ones and a shrine to my late father, “Do you know who these people are?” he asked. I said I did, but that they mattered to the old me, and the new me would have to learn how to relate to them because the old me had died.
I kept thinking, “The ‘me’ who was here before died, so I guess I will just try to get by with being this crazy person now, doomed to suffer permanent psychosis until I die.” Through the repeated reassurances of my guide, I eventually found a way back to sanity. I looked many times into his eyes to see if he was scared that I had permanently slipped away. Either he genuinely believed I hadn’t, or he was good at pretending (I am sure it was the former). I cannot imagine the panic and horror that I would have felt had he revealed even a flicker of doubt about my condition.
At the very end of my journey, my sanity seemed, at least to me, to be hanging by a thin thread. This occurred after having a gentle (yet awe-inspiring and ego-dissolving) experience that involved no fear whatsoever at any point. While my feeling of permanent psychosis disappeared before my guide left my home, part of the “I” who was “me” really won’t ever come back. Luckily, I had prepared myself to be ok with that outcome.",117453,17,Mushrooms - P. cubensis,3 g,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overwhelming Calm,Wheat,2023-09-13,2025-04-14,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 21,Recommended,155.0,lb,"I decided to take some psychedelic mushrooms around 5pm before a party that was meant to start at 8pm. I knew I would be cutting the timing close but did it anyway. My previous trip took around 4 hours, but I was hoping the smaller dose I planned on taking would lend the comedown to be less intense. My brain is still recovering from MDMA taken about a week prior and I was not feeling 100%. I felt a little nauseous before hand, I had drank a glass of Prosecco around an hour before the mushrooms.
I ate an entire stem of dried Penis Envy, around 0.8g and then split a head into 2 seeing that it was 1.4g in total. I attempted to eat half of this head but throw most of it up as the taste was awful. I then decided to take the other half as well and got it down using some water.
It took about 45 minutes for the effects to start kicking in, I was watching football at the time and went to lie down in bed with some music. The basslines coursed through my body like waves onto a beach, each beat in the song raised the intensity of everything. Breathing became a very manual and very challenging task, if I forgot to initiate the breath, I feel it never would have come. It would have been nice to not have to breathe in this moment. The music continued to be very enjoyable until about 6:30, when I decided I wanted the music, but not from headphones.
I moved into my living room where I plugged in my much larger speaker and continued the same song (something by Bob Moses at the time). The speaker has lights on it, which would have been nice if not for the strobe lights which are too jarring. At this time (6:45) I start to feel more nausea and stand outside my balcony to calm down. This helps, and I go back inside but leave the door and window open for fresh air. How loud the music is is impossible for me to tell, it envelops all sense of sound and dominates my body’s feelings. I move closer to the speaker until I’m sitting with my back to it to block out the lights. My blue carpet in front me turns into a sea, reacting as I prod it with my suddenly distant feeling hand. I spend maybe 10 minutes here until the nausea kicks in and I end up over my sink heaving, but I did not throw up. All the while I have to keep reminding myself that it’s ok to be late to the party, as this was causing me some anxiety.
I decide to sit back down on the couch and turn off all the lights, as well as close the door and window as I felt very cold. I drape a blanket over me and lean back into the couch. Slowly my senses fade away. When I close my eyes I do not see black, my entire sense of vision is simply gone. The idea of sight is very foreign to me. I concentrate on my breathing to reduce my nausea and this helps. Every breath becomes a monumental effort in of itself, and each breath was lost to time after it happens. The concept of time fades away, each breath its own moment in time. I remain in this deeply meditative state for maybe 10 minutes, yet it felt as if it was years, or a single blink.

Awakening from this state was like coming from a deep slumber. As my mind unfurls it feels like peeling back the layers on a great cocoon, reintegrating my senses to this unchanged world. My mind and its ability to form thoughts felt virgin, as if it had shedded an exoskeleton. My conscious self rose back into my body, I turned on the lights from my phone and as they grew in brightness, so did my connection to the world. This had lasted around 15 minutes.
I feel tremendously calm, my entire system had restarted and come back anew. I begin to describe the deeply meditative experience to my girlfriend over text and subsequently decide to write an entire report. I sit still on the couch aware of my senses until about 7:45 when I begin to type on my laptop. Mild visuals are still happening, my laptops keyboard feels angled and tilted, the letters on the screen have a depth and grow and shrink in size as I type. It is very easy to express emotion in this state. I takes be about 15 minutes to describe the majority of the experience, and around 8:15 I decide that I am ready to get up and go to the party.",117642,14,Alcohol - Beer/Wine,1 glass,oral,Mushrooms - P. cubensis,1.7 g,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lost in the Forest of the Mind,Barbarossa,2015-09-13,2025-04-25,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 17,Very Highly Recommended,120.0,lb,"It was early December of 2016 when George texted me asking if I'd like to trip the next morning with him and Paul in the canyon. It was around 1 am, I was up late as usual. I wasn't enthusiastic about it but I said why not, I always wanted to go hiking while tripping, and George would be pushy if I said no. I had tripped on acid maybe 20 times before this, and my max dosage was 5 hits. I had only ever had one mildly bad experience, but nothing horrible.
He picked me up around 6 am. It was colder than I had dressed for, a chilly 50 degrees. We went to the convenience store, had coffee, and stocked up on water and snack foods, then headed toward the summit of the canyon. When we got to the summit, Paul pulled out the acid. It was a Sonic the Hedgehog print, and at the sight of this horrible video game character I got my first bad vibes. George at first was questioning, saying he didn't wanna drop until we reached the waterfall at the bottom of the gorge. But we had only planned for a day hike, and since the acid would be peaking right around the time we reached the waterfall, we each took 3 hits.
The descent then commenced. It was around 7 am. I distributed apple Trident layers gum to Paul, George and myself, a brand I still cannot chew because of the memory I would soon attach to it. The acid took a while to kick in. We must've been an hour and a half into our journey before I began to feel any effects, which was unusual for me. As we reached the bottom of the canyon and headed toward the waterfall, I could finally feel it. Everything was beautiful, shimmering and breathing. We crossed the water on a log foot bridge, standing outside of time and admiring its beauty. We walked into a great opening and I let out a primal yawp. This was the best trip ever, in terms of the visuals I was perceiving.
We then began to walk through a small forest. It was dark but beautiful. Around this time was when things began to foreshadow the dark turn ahead. George commented that the forest reminded him of Aokigahara Forest - the Japanese wood of the suicides near Mt. Fuji infamous for the high incidence of people killing themselves in it's vast expanse. But at the time I thought nothing of the comment.
We then exited the densest part of the forest and began walking along the stream that would culminate in the waterfall. The rocky climbing, up-and-down motion was tiring. We took a break to eat. I took out a pastry and began eating it when I was suddenly overcome with the feeling that I was drowning, not on water but on air. I pulled out a bottle of water and poured in onto my face, trying to 'breathe' it. I quickly snapped out of it and began repeating 'I'm going to be ok. I'm going to be ok.' George was eating beef jerky - in retrospect, not a good thing to eat on acid - and seemed to be feeling bad vibes himself. We both told Paul that we should return to the jeep, but Paul insisted we trek further. He said we had to see the waterfall.
So we continued onward until we reached the falls. It hadn't rained in a while. The water was weak flowing, and the barren, desolate, neutral toned rocky landscape where once water flowed abundantly was menacing. An old man was there before us, and as we approached the falls, he was walking back in the direction he came from. He asked us how we were doing and tried to strike up a conversation. I did my best to play it cool, telling him we were hiking and really not much else. Despite how nervous I was, I was surprisingly more extroverted than I am usually. I did not feel like myself.
George's mind was at this point thoroughly warped. He thought every elderly man he had ever met was now the same person. Thinking this was the gentleman who owned the local burger joint, he praised the dude and said he loved his burgers. The man was confused. I have no recollection how that topic was ended, but before the man continued back home, he said he was enjoying this hike for the first and last time, before he was too old to see it. My memory here begins to get spotty, but I believe I started accidentally talking about mortality, saying something along the lines of 'Yeah well me and my friends are still young. We aren't going to die soon like you,' but the way I said it was in no way intentionally rude or mean.
This is where time stops. George begins shivering, and for what was either 3 minutes or half an hour, Paul and I huddled up to him, afraid that we would all soon die from the environment. George was going back and forth between the best mood he had been in and the deepest pits of existential horror. At one point, trying to encourage and help him, I pointed to the wilderness surrounding us and told him I was proud of him because he created it all.
While walking up the falls, several odd statements ensued. I became convinced that Paul was an ape. This was both physical, he's a very brutish looking dude, and because George and I often jab at him for being very primitive. Helping George climb up a particularly steep area, he looked at me wide-eyed and then called me 'brother', hugged me, and said 'thank you for saving me, god', addressing me as a deity. I, looking around, said, 'wow, this environment looks so real, the developers really outdid themselves on make a convincing video game'.
Paul is a very easy going, passive man who doesn't hold aggression towards anyone. George on the other hand is very pushy and willful. At one point Paul said something about some cheesy psychedelic rock band. An inside joke with us is mocking Paul's very narrow, limited taste. George calls him a void of a man because he really lacks depth, and doesn't ever really express himself beyond dopey yes/no terms. This must've really enraged George, because he then proceeded to punch him. I could feel reverberations through the atmosphere. Suddenly I became convinced that George would kill Paul, and then God would smite us. I broke it up and got George off of him. Things went back to normal. Or as normal as they can be, I guess, and we reached the top of the falls.
At one point we had to cross the relatively shallow stream. Rather than stepping on the stones to stay dry, I waded waist deep and began to tell Paul and George about my fear of drowning and of bodies of water, which is rooted in an early childhood near death experience.
George pulled out his phone. I associate phones with bad trips because mine was heavily linked to my first, relatively mild bad trip, so I avoid them altogether in trips now. I looked at his screen. He had his girlfriend's last name listed as 'blah blah blah'. I felt like this was some glitch in the system of reality and, alarmed, I wagged my finger and said 'no phones'. George looked astonished, as if I had just revealed the nature of reality to him, and adamantly threw his phone into the stream, something which we only later found out wasn't a hallucination.
For the next six hours, I relived my entire life over and over, at least 5 times. I recalled vividly the last time I had hiked in this canyon, with my father years before, and had illusions of killing him. I heard sirens all around me. I began writing in my notebook. I had no idea what I was writing at the time. George told me to write something in his handwriting with my hand, and then began ranting about how much he missed living in California. He became convinced that his uncle (who raised him) was dead. I retorted by saying our favorite professor was still alive, thus his uncle couldn't be dead. For a while we rocked back and forth in our separate insanities, me pleading for my mom and him for his uncle.
At one point I began narrating his consciousness - something I really have no other way of explaining. As he began ranting about his hatred for his cousin, I critiqued various aspects of his personality. This was a major event for him, but for me it was mostly impersonal and I don't recall much of it.
I sat down cross legged and closed my eyes. I was trying to snap out of it. But suddenly I felt like I was falling down a massive, endless pit, totally devoid of light. All around I heard the sounds of people coughing, choking, water splashing and occasionally a scream. I felt like I was in another dimension, beyond life and death. I felt like I was living in a facade, a simulation, and I had taken acid as a way to break free of this Matrix-like Baudrillardian nightmare, and now my interdimensional overlords, or God, or the aliens or whatever were punishing me for it,

sending me through a void of information overlord and breaking my mind with a jackhammer.
I came to and checked my watch. It was now 3pm. I had lost consciousness some 5 hours before. But suddenly I began to feel okay. Things still felt weird, but I could tell I was sobering up. George also snapped out of it at the same time. What was happening to Paul all this time? He was somehow totally unaffected and managed to have a good trip. I have scattered memories of him waving his fingers at us and saying 'snakes', at which point they looked like snake emojis to me, as well as him standing on a tall rock and calling himself the Lizard King. He did nothing to help us during our bad experiences. During all of this, I recall voices sounding like they were backtracked and just incredibly off, like the voice of the dwarf in the dream sequence of Twin Peaks.
After coming back to a relatively sound state of mine, I ran to the base of the waterfall to take a piss. It felt like it went on forever, and while I pissed I felt as if I was being stabbed all over my body. I looked in my journal. I had wrote 'please someone help me. My name is Harry. I have taken a substance I do not know what. My address is 123 Sesame Street. Please call this number and have them come pick me up. Please have mercy upon me God'
We descended back to the base of the waterfall. He grabbed at his pockets, realizing he didn't have his phone. We both simultaneously recalled him tossing it into the stream. He rushed to the stream and found it, terrified that it was destroyed. Miraculously, it survived over 5 hours totally submerged and still works perfectly to this day.
We walked back to the jeep, a journey which lasted about 3 hours. We didn't talk much, all of us trying to come to terms with what had just happened and focusing on getting back to the jeep before sunset. We were all still tripping heavy, but the worst of the mental tripping was gone, and it was now primarily visual. My phone began ringing constantly as I regained cellular service. I had tons of messages from my girlfriend, and a large amount of social media notifications. Talking to her was a great relief and definitely helped put a band aid on my psyche until I could sort this all out.
[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people.
Don't do it!

We got into the jeep and began the long, cautious drive home, with bright street lights becoming overwhelming and a total inability to see where cars were as they created long, lasting motion trails. It somehow didn't turn me off from psychedelics permanently, but it utterly shattered all of my previously held philosophical beliefs and for the next week I was incredibly depressed and emotionless.",110123,21,LSD,3 hits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Tribute to My Shaman,daytripper,2012-09-13,2024-11-21,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 24,Recommended,175.0,lb,"About a year ago a very good friend of a friend introduced me to DMT.  He is rather wealthy and a very free thinking liberal who had gotten into shamanic tribal rituals as a way to express his spirituality.  He explained to my friend how this has helped and guided him through difficult times in his life and asked if he would like to participate one night with him.  My friend liked what he heard, agreed and invited me to come along.  We were encouraged to come with a purpose and to treat it as a spiritual event rather than a recreational party to “see some cool shit.”  My friend is married with a few kids and says he received revelation that night which has helped him to this day.  I also feel like I received some guidance through those rituals which has helped me be a better person.
However, this trip report is not about DMT.  I just want to set up my ideology in regards to mind expanding substances. I am writing this in hopes to help the psychedelic community regain respect and the spiritual nature of these substances.  It is the loss of this spirituality which has caused them to become banned in our modern society.  Much benefit can come through mind expansion if done properly, but I feel that too many people are taking these things to get “fucked up” instead of finding ways to make the world a better place. I’ve smoked DMT 5 times total on 2 different occasions and only had 1 “bad” trip because I took the hits just to get crazy.  I was taken to a place I never want to go back to.  I have wanted to try acid for quite some time now and to increase my odds of having a “good” trip I took a spiritual approach to it.
to increase my odds of having a “good” trip I took a spiritual approach to it.
Here is my story:
After a long quest for some good acid I finally found some (that’s an entirely other story in itself) and then after another long quest to find some time to take it I finally did.  I prepared for the trip by going to the gym and having a relaxing sauna session to get my endorphins flowing in the morning.  The night before I listened to a bunch of Terence Mckennas speeches on how to take psychedelics to get myself in the right frame of mind.  I packed up everything I would need (food, water, pen and pad of paper, along with some valium just in case things got too gnarly) and dropped at noon.
Purpose for my trip – how can I better help myself and other people in this life.
Mind Set – pretty nervous about the unknown but excited for the trip
Setting – trip alone in a giant garden park about a 10 minute walk away from my house.
+0 - I kept the small blotter tab in my mouth for 20 minutes as I made my final preparations to head to a nearby park, which has an immensely beautiful flower garden that takes up about a half mile squared and looks out over the city.  It reminded me of Alice in Wonderland even when I wasn’t on drugs.  As I was walking to the park I started to feel the initial effects.  I have never taken acid before so all I knew about it was from what I’ve read on the internet, and in retrospect that is like one saying I know what making love is like from watching porn.  You can't even come close to understanding the intensity and fullness of the experience unless you are the one going through it.  Like the Grateful Dead say in their song Ripple,
“There is a road, no simple highway,
Between the dawn and the dark of night,
And if you go no one may follow,
That path is for your steps alone.”
+1 hour - I could feel the energy flowing through my body.  It truly felt electric or chemical.  I never knew what people meant until I felt it myself.  I didn’t think I was tripping yet, I just felt high, so I sat on a bench and began to write down some notes.  When I was done I looked at the ground and it started to swirl ever so slightly, which made me nervous for a second then happy because I knew the tab had worked and was the dose I wanted to take (which in my best guess was about 50 micrograms because it was just over the threshold dose of 30 mics).
+1:15 – when my eyes were closed I began to see flashes of light but no real hallucinations.  The energy became more intense and my mind began to work faster and faster.
+1:30 – I was walking to another part of the park and began to feel like the acid was taking over my body and breaking me apart.  This feeling is best described as my body being gently defragmented.  My anxiety was climbing because I noticed I was starting to act funny. I couldn’t do anything for more than 5 seconds at a time.  I would start to walk one way and decide that wasn’t where I wanted to go, so I would head a different way, then repeat that process several more times within a minute.  I would grab my water bottle for a drink, get it half way to my mouth and decide I didn’t want it anymore, put it back in my pocket then want a drink again.  I would start to take my jacket off cuz I felt hot and then zip it up again because I wanted it on.  Needless to say I was trippin balls in the park.  I felt like the only thing that would make me feel better was to sing and dance around like Indians when they are doing a peyote ritual.  However, I could not do this at that point (1hr 38mins into the trip) so to lower my anxiety a bit I popped 10mg of the Valium I had, which I am SOOOO thankful for.  I chose this dose because I received a prescription for them after a sports injury where I would take 5mg and I didn’t feel like it did anything to me at all.  So I figured 10mg would be enough to kill the anxiety without altering the trip too significantly.  The feeling I had right before I took the valium was one of impending doom like I couldn’t even make it to the next park bench 100 yards away.  This later became the most spiritual part of my trip (discovered later) because of the immensely overwhelming feelings of impossibleness to complete my journey.  Within 5 minutes the valium began to kick in and my situation felt manageable again.
Within 5 minutes the valium began to kick in and my situation felt manageable again.
+2:30 – 5:30 I walked back to my house, still on edge a little but trying to enjoy the trip and ate a little bit of food (I had all my food prepared so it was easy to access when the time came).  After that I grabbed my laptop, plugged in some headphones and started listening to classical music and nature sounds.  The next 3 hours was some of the most beautiful and enlightening time of my life to date.
I realized that acid isn’t about visuals for me this time.  It was about being comfortable and accepting the world for what it is.  When I try and control everything (which is impossible for me on LSD) I have a very difficult and anxious time and cannot enjoy the beauty of the world.  I was not having wild colorful hallucinations like some people describe.  I would consider them very mild and just over baseline, which is why I would estimate my dose at 50 micrograms.  I would have to look at something for a second for it to bend or melt, but when I did it was beautiful.  The stone wall above the fireplace was flowing like lava.  The patterns on the rock looked like stone colored flames.  Tables and desks would morph into impossible space bending shapes.  There is a picture of Time Square on one of the walls and the buildings would dance to the music.  At one point they were dancing the waltz.  The lamp shade seemed like it was playing the harp for me during one part of a song.  I was able to look at myself in the mirror and see my eyes pop out of my head and my body and face morph into an alien like creature and actually enjoy what I saw instead of fear it. My point is, this trip for me wasn’t about the visuals, but being comfortable in that world so that I could enjoy the beauty it had to show me.  Thinking back on when I was in the park, desperate and overwhelmed by the thought of not being able to make it to my next stop it reminded me of someone who was on the edge of suicide or fed up with their life (at no point did I feel like harming myself or others during my trip, these thoughts are in retrospect).  Those people are not able to enjoy the true beauty of life because they are not comfortable in their situation.   My quest for this trip was to find ways to better help myself and others in this life and my conclusion was it is my mission to make people feel as comfortable, loved, accepted and appreciated as possible so that they can enjoy the true beauty of life like I was able to.
+530 – 800 – the mind affects of the drug have calmed down, I am able to regain my natural thought process, for the most part, and the visuals have subsided.  I get some more to eat and just lay down to reflect on my trip.
+12:00 I get in bed but cannot fall asleep until 1:30.  Psychedelics are very hard on me mentally and have a long lasting effect.  When I tripped mushrooms I felt like I went the full 8 hours on just 1 gram.  One thing that helped keep me calm on the comedown (and I didn’t take any more valium since the initial 10 mgs) was to realize that I would trip until I woke up the next morning.  Thankfully the intense part of my journey only lasted about 5 hours, which is still a long ass time, but I’ve read some reports where people go fully back into the trip at 8 hours. I was grateful that didn’t happen to me.
Just as you would not take a vacation without a plan of where you want to go and what you want to accomplish beforehand, one needs to prepare their mind and body for such an intense experience to get the most out of it.  Some people can take acid and go about their day normally on it but I cannot.
After tripping this way I don’t think that I will ever do it any other way.
When I felt I was done tripping I called my friend who acted as my shaman for my first DMT trips and thanked him for showing me the ways of spirituality through psychedelics, he was grateful to hear from me.  I called my other friend who was with me the night of that first DMT trip and told him what happened and that I was grateful he invited me to my initial experience.  It is now the next morning and my mind feels great and the visuals are gone.  Sometimes I think I notice a little residual visuals but probably not.  I am not the hippy type and if you looked at me you would never guess that I like mind expanding drugs, but I am grateful for every experience I’ve had and hope that my future experiences can be increasingly more beautiful and helpful than they have been up to this point. I wish the same upon all who read this and any noble traveler who dares embark on a journey through the mind.",95492,35,LSD,1 hit,,Pharms - Diazepam,10 mg,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Life Changing Encounter with The Other,mindexplorer,2010-09-13,2012-03-16,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: 20,Very Highly Recommended,135.0,lb,"I decided to fast for 30 hours before participating in the ceremony. I knew that vomiting was inevitable, and I had been told that fasting would give me a stronger experience. I had pretty bad altitude sickness because I had just arrived in Cusco (elevation 3326 m), so it wasn’t hard to fast. At sunset, we took an old-school volkswagon beetle up to the top of one of the hills surrounding Cusco. We entered a fairly spacious hut; three bed-mats with plenty of blankets were lined up in front of an altar. I remember having a conversation with the Curanderismo while he was preparing for the long night ahead. I distinctly remember him saying: “Ayahuasca no es una droga. Ayahuasca es La Medecina.” That resounded in me.
He began the ceremony by lighting a candle inside of a large frame with holes running along the sides. This gave the room an eerie glow, as the candle flickered and projected shadows along the walls. He then proceded to fill his mouth with coca leaves, tucking them under his lip as he chanted a ritual song. Tobacco and coca are sacred to the Curaderismos, for they allow contact with the spirits. He then pulled out an empty, plastic water bottle filled with some dark fluid, the Ayahuasca. He blessed the Ayahausca with a prayer, then blew over the top of the bottle before pouring the liquid into small, ceramic glasses. He handed each of us the drink, then gave us individual blessings by blowing tobacco smoke all over us. He told me to drink it all at once. It tasted like some strong, exotic, bitter wine, but it wasn’t nearly as disgusting as I had expected. I was pleased by this.
The purge happened after about 20 minutes. It didn’t last long. After I was certain that all of the Ayahuasca had left me, I got comfortable and laid down. There were some windows on the thatched roof, which allowed me to see the night sky. When I closed my eyes, I began to see geometrical patterns, fractals actually, all across my visual field. Then I felt a presence, as if I was surrounded by dozens of people. They were there to comfort me, to calm me down, and I began to feel wonderful. I heard, or possibly felt, a woman assure me that everything was going to be ok, and she beckoned me to come with her into the spirit world. She felt very motherly, which evokes images of “mother earth” or “panchamama”, as they say in Quechua. Then a red light appeared which jolted me up. The Curanderismo was staring straight at me, and then he asked me, “You O.K., (x)?”  He would ask me that question throughout the entire night. It’s actually a joke I still have with one of my friends who was there with me. Even when I was uncontrollably hallucinating, I would still respond “si”. It almost amused me, because I would always have to think for few seconds, “Am I ok?” I always was, and I’m very glad he would ask. There were some difficult situations that he helped me through later in the night. Ayahuasca should never be used without a shaman.
The Ayahuascero played sacred songs, ancient songs, beautiful in their own right, but not comparable to anything I had ever heard before, except for maybe the chanting of Chasidic rabbis. He used drums and flutes and vocal intonations to guide our experiences. The shaman uses these auditory signals purposefully to evoke visual imagery within the participants. The songs, or Icarus, convey information, stories, about their ancestors. My visions would consist of jungles and jaguars and hunts and feasts and people, and it reminded me of the Torah, just their jungle version of it. For hours he was consistently able to provoke this imagery. I believe this may represent a novel form of communication that has yet to be studied by modern science. It’s worthy of investigation.
During the first 3-4 hours, I came into direct contact with multiple hyperdimensional entities, also known as spirits or angels. However, there were many different types of entities I encountered, and the differences must be addressed in order to understand the phenomenon. Some spirits had human qualities, which ranged from ordinary to powerful shamans. I remember one entity had a very strong presence; the Ayahuascero became silent, and the candle began flickering furiously when the spirit entered the room. Many of the spirits would enter my body, and I could feel them; I felt like most of them were healing me, although some would speak to me in exotic languages that I couldn’t understand. Some spirits were not human at all, and if I were to guess, I would say they were plant spirits. I could just tell. Some spirits seemed like they were responsible for our existence, as if they played a role in the unfolding of the present moment. At first, my reaction to these spirits was that this was ridiculous, that they must just be hallucinations. But after about an hour of observing them, and scrutinizing them, I came to the rational, semi-empirical conclusion that they were real. They passed all of my cognitive tests for what spirits would actually look like if they were real, by that I mean they were far stranger than anything I could have ever imagined to be real. However, I must stress that there are no words adequate in describing them, and most of them were felt, not necessarily seen, in the traditional sense at least. It’s just one of those things that may sound ludicrous to somebody reading this, but makes perfect sense if you actually experience it.
At some point I realized that my experience was over. It went by too quickly. I hadn’t seen my spirit animal, I hadn’t had an out of body experience, I hadn’t felt the presence God, I had just interacted with these spirits that showed me random shit. That was it. But what insights had I gained? It was a cool experience and all, but not the most profound experience of my life. I was a little disappointed. However, the Curanderismo noticed this. He laughed and said I could always just drink more; he said I would fully enter the spirit world if I drank more. I was a little nervous about that prospect, and went into the bathroom to fully think it over. In the end, I realized that I might not have the opportunity to do this again.
I drank the second glass of ayahuasca. I had no idea what was about to happen. While I was waiting for the ayahuasca to take effect, I could hear what sounded like a few dozen dogs right outside of our hut. In Cusco, dogs travel in packs; they aren’t confined to the backyards of their owners. They began to growl, and soon a huge fight broke out between two of the dogs. The intensity of this situation, with over a dozen dogs barking and growling at one another, made me feel extremely uncomfortable. Then the purge happened, and I was immediately catapulted into the psychedelic realm. I kept on thinking to myself: “Why did I drink it again?”  “This is too powerful.” “What is happening to me?” “Where did the spirits go?” “Why is the shaman silent?”
I heard this loud noise, like somebody was turning a nob inside of my head that controlled all of the possible frequencies of sound. I also began to enter these extraordinary visual realms, and then immediately forget what happened. Visions were flowing so fast that I couldn’t comprehend anything. However, the experience came in waves, and when I was aware enough to think about my situation, I realized that I was experiencing my subconscious. I began to analyze myself, and I felt like I was at the cusp of realizing what a thought was. Then I realized it was a paradox, how can a thought be used to understand what thoughts are? I also had many personal realizations about life, my family, and myself. I understood that our time on Earth was finite.
At some point the dogs stopped fighting, and I became calm again. I laid down, and looked through the roof at one of the stars. At this point, I could understand the dogs. Communication with animals is definitely possible. That sounds really weird, but I could literally understand and empathize, on a deep emotional level, the information that the dogs were conveying in their howls. This sparked profound realizations. I realized that on a fundamental level, all conscious entities were the same. The only differences between our consciousness, and the consciousness of dogs, were merely different wavelengths within a greater medium.
Upon this realization, my vision became engulfed with a white light. The light was so bright and beautiful that I began to uncontrollably cry. I knew that I was experiencing the same white light people describe upon death. It was the source of all consciousness. It was omnipresent, eternal, and about as close to a description of God as you can get. This must be God. I understood how all life, and the universe, was connected by fractals in this hyperdimensional membrane. I felt like my soul had connected to an ocean made of light, and tears flowed down my cheeks as I saw the entire universe , galaxies and all.
I could feel the ayahuasca coursing throughout my veins. I noticed that I couldn’t feel my hands; my body slowly became numb. I accepted God, in all of his glory, and prayed that I would be safe. There were no entities to guide me this time.
Very soon I had no body. I just was. Complete and utter transcendence. But I could still see, which puzzled me, because I had no eyes. I actually began to float out of my body, and into the room. I could see my life-less body, laying down, with my hands across my chest. I could see the shaman, and my two friends, (Y) was crouched in the fetal position. But there was also this violet light, and it seemed to be coming out of my body; the room was filled with this light. I wasn’t scared because I knew that out-of-body experiences are common on ayahausca, but I never thought it would feel this real. The realization that I had become some sort of hyperdimensional entity freaked me out. What if I never returned to my body? Was I dead? Immediately, I returned back to my body after thinking those thoughts. I was both filled with relief, that I was alive, and regret, that I hadn’t gone further into the spirit realm. However, my body was still fairly numb, and raising my hands gave me the sensation of flying through some ethereal realm.
Ayahuasca is gentle. The effects just slowly taper off, and there’s a calm afterglow. I had no desire to return to that realm. I got what I had come for. It’s amazing how quickly you forget what the experience was like. Within a few hours, I didn’t even have the ability to imagine what I had just felt. My strong convictions about the existence of God and Spirits declined, but at the same time, I knew that while I was experiencing it, my core self, was there. I trust myself, and I trust my judgement, even on Ayahuasca. I realized that there is legitimacy in spirituality. Even if God doesn’t exist, I know that God is a perception that people have the potential to have. At least the stories aren’t completely based in bullshit. I feel like ayahuasca prepares you for death as well. I am no longer afraid of death. We will all eventually die. It takes away the mystery; allows you to at least imagine what the afterlife might be like. What’s the point of believing nothing happens after death anyway? It’s fucking depressing.
Reflecting upon my experience, I am no longer the same person. First of all, the Ayahuasca literally did heal me of certain gastrointestinal discomforts that I had had since first grade. I feel much more in touch with my body as well. I no longer drink alcohol; I have absolutely no desire to use drugs for temporary pleasure. I exercise on a daily basis. I feel as if my life actually has a purpose, and I can’t waste any time. I need to live in the moment, and just have as many experiences as I can. I’ve never felt more happy, and content with my existence. I’m excited about what’s to come; about where my life’s journey will take me next. There is still so much we have left to learn. We can never forget that.",91566,52291,Ayahuasca,,oral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Learning to Live,Osta,2009-09-13,2009-10-31,Gender: Male,Age at time of experience: Not Given,,72.0,kg,"For the evening, I made plans for myself and all of my friends to go to Javier's ceremony, and everybody agreed.  However, when the time to go came, all of them changed their minds.  I too felt tired, and would have stayed home if I had the slightest excuse to do so.  I talked to Javier about the possibility of staying home, but he insisted on me going.  I even mentioned the possibility of going just for a healing, without drinking, but he said that it would be better to drink.  I decided to listen to him and just go.
There were about 12 people who were going, but they all had something in common.  It was a great group, with many friends.  I was happy to be part of it.
The ceremony itself was the most amazing I ever had.  I understood a lot about the nature of the universe, and about the power of love.  I felt like I communicated with God.  I could hear spirits all around me, singing along with Javier and his disciples.  It was easy to pick out the voices of the female spirits, because I knew there were no women sitting beside me, but whether there were any male spirits singing, I don't know.  The spirits knew all of the words of the songs, and sang flawlessly.  The first woman had a sort of lazy voice that was slightly out of tune, but the woman who sang after was extremely energetic and sang beautifully.  For a while, I just sat and listened.
I had visions and insights about human beings, about how we live, about our ignorance, and about our potential.  At a particular moment, I thought about Ninfa.  Then I realized that thinking about her may be distracting, so I stopped that thought after a split second.  However, it was too late, already the thought had an effect.  I felt her come and sit next to me, on my right.  It felt beautiful.  Then Kirill and Alex came and sat on my left.  We were all there together!  Throughout the night, I felt many spirits coming and sitting or standing next to me.
I thought about divorce, and people who marry and divorce three times.  Something like that cannot be normal.  And I realized that people don't know what they are looking for.  They have material success, but not happiness.  Yet they keep chasing after more material success.  What they don't realize is that if you drink salt water and it doesn't clench your thirst, it is of no use to drink more of it.
I saw in a vision how poor people live.  The 3 by 3 meter room in which Karina lives with her aging mother came vividly to mind.  “These people don't have anything”, I thought.  “They are so poor, it's unbelievable.”  Maybe Karina met me when she did for a reason.  Maybe she really needed some financial help for her birthday.  I decided right there that I would give her another 20 dollars as a present.  It was clear to me that if one gives, one will receive.  I decided to give what I can.
As my trance deepened, Life itself was presented before me.  I contemplated it in awe. Every second, life continued.  Yet every second was a great mystery.  I focused on my breath and tried to stay centered. Realizations came to me, many of which I have now forgotten.  For example, I had an idea for a book that would have really helped people to see the spiritual truth of this world.  However, later on, when I though about it, I couldn't remember anything I wanted to write.
I saw in my visions that anything that helps life, that allows life and makes us experience it more fully is good and enlightening, while anything that denies life is a sin.  Therefore, losing consciousness after drinking alcohol is against life.  The more I drink, the less aware I become.  The same is true about philosophy.  I can write anything I want about philosophy, but if I am not living, what use is any writing?  A philosophy is mental, and everything mental is a barrier to living life fully.  I saw this in a vision.  These realizations about life had a very Buddhist feel about them.  I understood the importance of doing things properly.  One thing at a time is enough.
As I sat there, just breathing, I felt that I was in direct contact with life.  My heart was filled with love for everyone.  Everything came back to me, and I saw myself as a central focal figure in this thing called life.  I saw each family unit as a basic trinity.  The sacred love between the man and the woman, and the presence of the child all had mystical significance.  The stories of Adam and Eve and others came to my mind, but not as myths or historical facts.  Everything every true religion was talking about was right here, right now.
Soon, very intense cleansing began, and I started to vomit chunks of stuff.  It was difficult work.  With a lot of force, I expelled one after another huge chunks of stuff.  The entire process lasted for about 2 or 3 hours.  By the end of it, a chunk got stuck in my throat, and I could feel it with my fingers from the outside.  Inside, I felt a pain each time I swallowed.  On the way home, I continued throwing up and coughing up small chunks of this piece of phlegm that was stuck in my throat.  It looked white and sticky, and I was only able to get rid of tiny pieces of it at a time.  The effects of the medicine were gone, but my stomach continued working, collecting old energies to be purged.
